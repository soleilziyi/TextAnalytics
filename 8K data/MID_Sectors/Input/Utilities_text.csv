SUCH PER SHARE AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON THE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION OF EACH GROUP INCLUDED IN VECTREN’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS DIVIDED BY VECTREN’S BASIC AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ANALYZING UNDERLYING AND ONGOING BUSINESS TRENDS IS AIDED BY THE REMOVAL OF COAL MINING AND PROLIANCE RESULTS IN THE RESPECTIVE YEAR OF DISPOSITION AND THE RATIONALE FOR USING SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES IS THAT, THROUGH THE DISPOSITION OF THE COAL MINING SEGMENT AND THROUGH THE DISPOSITION BY PROLIANCE HOLDINGS OF CERTAIN PROLIANCE ENERGY ASSETS, THE COMPANY HAS NOW EXITED THE COAL MINING AND GAS MARKETING BUSINESSES.

THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE COMPANY'S PRESS RELEASE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP"").  A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING AND COAL MINE RECLAMATION, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS.  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP.  MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE COMPANY'S PRESS RELEASE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP"").  A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS.  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP.  MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.

PNM PLANS TO RE-FILE FOR A GENERAL RATE INCREASE UTILIZING THE 2016 FTY BY SEPTEMBER 1, 2015. AS A RESULT, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW RATES AT PNM COULD BE DELAYED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016.

A SUBSTANTIALLY FINAL SJGS PARTICIPANT RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT (THE “RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT”) WAS ALSO SUBMITTED TO THE NMPRC, IDENTIFYING THE ONGOING OWNERSHIP OF SJGS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.  THIS RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE EXIT OF CERTAIN PARTICIPANTS WHILE, COMBINED WITH THE SHUTDOWN OF SJGS UNITS 2 AND 3 UNDER THE REVISED STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR SJGS’S COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT, DEFINING THE TERMS OF OWNERSHIP OF THE REMAINING CAPACITY AMONG THE REMAINING PARTICIPANTS. THE AGREEMENTS WERE SUBMITTED AS PART OF PNM’S ONGOING REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS SEEKING NMPRC APPROVAL OF THE SJGS PLAN SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FILED IN OCTOBER 2014.  APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN IMPLEMENTING A REVISED STATE PLAN THAT BENEFITS CUSTOMERS AND COMPLIES WITH FEDERAL VISIBILITY REGULATIONS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT.  ON MAY 14, 2015, PNM ENTERED INTO A LETTER AGREEMENT (THE “WESTMORELAND LETTER AGREEMENT”) WITH WESTMORELAND COAL COMPANY (“WESTMORELAND”).  PURSUANT TO THE WESTMORELAND LETTER AGREEMENT, PNM AND WESTMORELAND HAVE AGREED TO EXECUTE AND DELIVER THE CSA, AS WELL AS A RECLAMATION SERVICES AGREEMENT AND A COAL COMBUSTION RESIDUALS DISPOSAL AGREEMENT, EACH SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE FORM SUBMITTED BY PNM TO THE NMPRC ON A CONFIDENTIAL BASIS ON MAY 1, 2015.

AS PRESENTLY DRAFTED, THE CSA WOULD HAVE AN INITIAL TERM THROUGH JUNE 30, 2022, WITH ANY EXTENSION THEREOF TO BE AGREED UPON BY THE END OF 2018.  IN THE EVENT THE INITIAL TERM IS NOT EXTENDED, PNM WOULD HAVE DISCRETION TO PURCHASE (OR ASSIGN RIGHTS TO PURCHASE) SJCC AT THE END OF THE INITIAL TERM.  THE CSA WILL BE A FIXED PRICE CONTRACT, SUBJECT TO ESCALATION WITH PASS THROUGH COSTS ON CERTAIN LIMITED ITEMS.  THE CSA WILL CONTAIN CERTAIN “TAKE OR PAY” PROVISIONS AND REQUIRE WESTMORELAND TO DELIVER 100% OF THE COAL NEEDS OF SJGS.

THE ORDER MODIFIES THE RATE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM (RAM) PORTION OF THE DECOUPLING MECHANISM TO BE CAPPED AT THE LESSER OF THE RAM REVENUE ADJUSTMENT AS CURRENTLY DETERMINED (ADJUSTED TO ELIMINATE THE 90% LIMITATION ON THE INCREMENTAL RATE BASE RAM ADJUSTMENT THAT WAS ORDERED IN THE SCHEDULE A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDING) AND A RAM REVENUE ADJUSTMENT CALCULATED BASED ON THE CUMULATIVE ANNUAL COMPOUNDED INCREASE IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PRICE INDEX (GDPPI) APPLIED TO THE 2014 ANNUALIZED TARGET REVENUES (ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN ITEMS SPECIFIED IN THE ORDER). THE 2014 ANNUALIZED TARGET REVENUES REPRESENT THE TARGET REVENUES FROM THE LAST RATE CASE, AND RAM REVENUES, OFFSET BY EARNINGS SHARING CREDITS, IF ANY, ALLOWED UNDER THE DECOUPLING MECHANISM THROUGH THE 2014 DECOUPLING FILING. THE UTILITIES MAY APPLY TO THE PUC FOR APPROVAL OF RECOVERY OF REVENUES FOR MAJOR PROJECTS (INCLUDING RELATED BASELINE PROJECTS GROUPED TOGETHER FOR CONSIDERATION AS MAJOR PROJECTS) THROUGH THE RAM ABOVE THE RAM CAP OR OUTSIDE OF THE RAM THROUGH THE RENEWABLE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM (REIP) SURCHARGE OR OTHER ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM. THE UTILITIES AND THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE ARE DIRECTED TO DEVELOP STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR ELIGIBILITY OF PROJECTS AND DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE COST RECOVERY ABOVE THE RAM CAP FOR PUC APPROVAL. THE RAM IS AMENDED ON AN INTERIM BASIS PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE PUC’S REVIEW OF THE UTILITIES’ POWER SUPPLY IMPROVEMENT PLANS. THE TRIENNIAL RATE CASE CYCLE REQUIRED UNDER THE DECOUPLING MECHANISM CONTINUES TO SERVE AS THE MAXIMUM PERIOD BETWEEN THE FILING OF GENERAL RATE CASES, AND THE AMENDMENTS TO THE RAM DO NOT LIMIT OR DILUTE THE ORDINARY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE UTILITIES TO SEEK RATE RELIEF ACCORDING TO CONVENTIONAL/TRADITIONAL RATEMAKING PROCEDURES.IN MAKING THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE RAM ADJUSTMENT, THE PUC STATED THE CHANGES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE PUC WITH CONTROL OF AND PRIOR REGULATORY REVIEW OVER SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONS TO BASELINE PROJECTS BETWEEN RATE CASES. IT DOES NOT DEPRIVE THE UTILITIES OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOVER ANY PRUDENTLY INCURRED EXPENDITURE OR LIMIT ORDERLY RECOVERY FOR NECESSARY EXPANDED CAPITAL PROGRAMS. THE REVENUE BALANCING ACCOUNT (RBA), WHICH IS THE SALES DECOUPLING COMPONENT, IS RETAINED, AND THE PUC MADE NO CHANGE IN THE AUTHORIZED RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY. PERFORMANCE BASED RATEMAKING IS NOT ADOPTED AT THIS TIME. ON APRIL 15, 2015, THE UTILITIES SUBMITTED REVISED ANNUAL DECOUPLING FILINGS FOR TARIFFED RATES TO BE EFFECTIVE FROM JUNE 1, 2015 THROUGH MAY 31, 2016 (UNLESS THE FILINGS ARE MODIFIED OR SUSPENDED BY THE PUC), AND REFLECTED REVISIONS TO THE RAM BASED ON THE ORDER. THE REVISED 2015 ANNUAL INCREMENTAL RAM REVENUES FOR THE THREE UTILITIES BASED ON THE ORDER AMOUNTED TO $26.2 MILLION, COMPARED TO THE 2015 ANNUAL INCREMENTAL REVENUES OF $31.6 MILLION FILED ON MARCH 31, 2015 BASED ON THE METHODOLOGY PRIOR TO THE MODIFICATION OF THE ORDER. THE REVISED TARIFFS ALSO INCLUDE THE COLLECTION OR REFUND OF THE ACCRUED REVENUE BALANCING ACCOUNT (RBA) BALANCE AND ASSOCIATED REVENUE TAXES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND ANY ACCRUED EARNING SHARING MECHANISM CREDITS. THE NET AMOUNT TO BE COLLECTED UNDER THE TARIFFS IS $14.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE UTILITIES. THE REVISED TARIFFS IF APPROVED WOULD RESULT IN AN ESTIMATED MONTHLY BILL IMPACT OF 56 CENTS FOR A TYPICAL RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER ON OAHU USING 600 KILOWATT HOURS (KWH) A MONTH, $1.10 FOR A TYPICAL RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER ON HAWAII ISLAND USING 500 KWH, AND 60 CENTS FOR A TYPICAL RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER ON MAUI USING 600 KWH. THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE WILL HAVE 30 DAYS TO REVIEW THE FILING. IF APPROVED BY THE PUC, THE 2015 REVISED DECOUPLING TARIFFS WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FROM JUNE 1, 2015 1TO MAY 31, 2016.THE ORDER ALSO DIRECTS THE PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING TO SUBMIT INITIAL BRIEFS WITHIN 60 DAYS THAT ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING ISSUES:  (1) WHETHER, AND IF SO, HOW THE CONVENTIONAL PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE MECHANISMS PROPOSED IN THIS PROCEEDING SHOULD BE REFINED AND IMPLEMENTED IN THIS DOCKET; (2) WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE STEPS, PROCESSES AND TIMING FOR DETERMINING MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GENERAL RATE CASE FILING AND REVIEW PROCESS; AND (3) WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE STEPS, PROCESSES, AND TIMING TO FURTHER CONSIDER THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE ENERGY COST ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE (ECAC) IDENTIFIED IN THIS PROCEEDING.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP. MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS.  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP.  MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

(HEP) UNDER A POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT THAT WOULD EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 30, 2030 (THE POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT). ON DECEMBER 22, 2015, HAWAII ELECTRIC LIGHT ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT, SUBJECT TO HAWAII PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (PUC) APPROVAL, TO ACQUIRE THE ASSETS OF HEP FOR APPROXIMATELY $84.5 MILLION.  BY OWNING THE PLANT, HAWAII ELECTRIC LIGHT WILL HAVE GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO CYCLE HEP’S GENERATING UNITS, EXERCISING GREATER OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPORT RENEWABLE ENERGY AND USE HEP’S EFFICIENT GENERATING UNITS. THE HEP PLANT CONTRIBUTES 23% OF HAWAII ISLAND’S GENERATING CAPACITY AND PRODUCED ABOUT 16% OF THE ISLANDS ENERGY IN 2014. THE PLANT INCLUDES TWO COMBUSTION TURBINES, A STEAM GENERATING UNIT, AND TWO HEAT RECOVERY STEAM GENERATORS. THIS COMBINATION OF GENERATORS ALLOWS THE PLANT TO OPERATE AS A MORE EFFICIENT “COMBINED CYCLE” PLANT WITH THE STEAM GENERATOR RUNNING ON THE CAPTURED WASTE HEAT FROM THE TWO COMBUSTION TURBINES, PRODUCING ADDITIONAL POWER WITHOUT BURNING MORE FUEL. THE COMBUSTION TURBINES CURRENTLY RUN ON NAPHTHA, A CLEANER FOSSIL FUEL, AND COULD BE CONVERTED TO USE EVEN CLEANER AND POTENTIALLY LOWER-COST NATURAL GAS OR RENEWABLE BIOFUELS IN THE FUTURE. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN LOWER COSTS TO CUSTOMERS AND WILL SUPPORT THE INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FROM VARIABLE SOURCES SUCH AS SOLAR AND WIND. CUSTOMERS ARE EXPECTED TO SAVE FROM THE ELIMINATION OF PAYMENTS TO HEP UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT FOR MAKING ENERGY AVAILABLE 24 HOURS A DAY, AS WELL AS THE ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF OTHER COSTS. THE COMBUSTION TURBINE EQUIPMENT USED AT THE HEP FACILITY IS THE SAME AS THAT USED AT ANOTHER HAWAII ELECTRIC LIGHT GENERATING STATION, LEVERAGING OPERATIONAL EXPERTISE AND ALLOWING BETTER PROCUREMENT AND UTILIZATION OF EQUIPMENT PARTS.

ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.  ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2015, NATIONAL FUEL GAS COMPANY (THE
COMPANY) ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE FOLLOWING LENDERS: JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION; BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.; HSBC BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION; WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION; CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE, NEW YORK BRANCH; CITIZENS BANK, N.A.; U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION; M&T BANK; PNC BANK,
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION; BRANCH BANKING AND TRUST COMPANY; FIRST NIAGARA BANK; KEYBANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION; THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON; AND COMERICA BANK. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES A $750 MILLION MULTI-YEAR UNSECURED COMMITTED REVOLVING CREDIT
FACILITY THROUGH DECEMBER 5, 2019, PLUS A $500 MILLION 364-DAY UNSECURED COMMITTED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THROUGH SEPTEMBER 29, 2016. WITH RESPECT TO BORROWINGS UNDER THE MULTI-YEAR FACILITY, THE COMPANY IS PERMITTED (BUT NOT REQUIRED)
TO ELECT A MATURITY DATE THAT IS 364 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE BORROWING. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES AN OPTION FOR THE COMPANY TO REQUEST INCREASES IN THE AGGREGATE MULTI-YEAR COMMITMENTS TO AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $850 MILLION, SUBJECT TO
CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY MAY USE THE PROCEEDS OF LOANS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER (I) ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, (II) OTHER SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES AND (III) MATURING LONG-TERM
DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND OTHER LAWFUL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDS AND
RESTATES A FIVE-YEAR, $750 MILLION UNSECURED COMMITTED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY IN DECEMBER 2014. THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THAT $750 MILLION FACILITY. 
RATES FOR BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANYS CREDIT RATINGS AND ARE BASED, AT THE COMPANYS ELECTION, UPON WHETHER
THE BORROWING IS A EURODOLLAR LOAN OR AN ALTERNATE BASE RATE LOAN. EURODOLLAR LOANS WILL BEAR INTEREST AT AN ADJUSTED LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED (LIBO) RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM 0.80% TO 1.525%, DEPENDING ON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE
COMPANY. ALTERNATE BASE RATE LOANS WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO THE SUM OF (1) THE GREATEST OF (A) THE PRIME RATE, (B) THE FEDERAL FUNDS EFFECTIVE RATE PLUS 1/2 OF 1%, AND (C) AN ADJUSTED LIBO RATE FOR A
ONE-MONTH INTEREST PERIOD PLUS 1%, AND (2) AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM 0% TO 0.525%, DEPENDING ON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AGREES TO PAY THE LENDERS A FACILITY
FEE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THE FACILITY FEE RATE IS DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE COMPANY AND RANGES FROM A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO 0.075% TO 0.225% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. BASED ON THE COMPANYS CURRENT
CREDIT RATINGS, THE FACILITY FEE RATE WOULD BE 0.15% PER ANNUM.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS REPRESENTATIONS AND AFFIRMATIVE, NEGATIVE AND
FINANCIAL COVENANTS USUAL AND CUSTOMARY FOR AGREEMENTS OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS COVENANTS THAT PLACE CONDITIONS UPON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH OTHER COMPANIES, SELL ANY MATERIAL PART OF ITS BUSINESS OR
PROPERTY, AND INCUR LIENS. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES A COVENANT THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT PERMIT ITS DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION RATIO TO EXCEED 0.65 AT THE LAST DAY OF ANY FISCAL QUARTER. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS A CROSS-DEFAULT
PROVISION WHEREBY THE FAILURE BY THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER OTHER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AGGREGATING $40.0 MILLION OR MORE, OR THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS AFFECTING THOSE OTHER BORROWING
ARRANGEMENTS, COULD TRIGGER AN OBLIGATION TO REPAY ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS ADDITIONAL CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PAYMENT DEFAULTS, MATERIAL
INACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, COVENANT DEFAULTS, CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY EVENTS, CERTAIN JUDGMENT DEFAULTS AND CERTAIN ERISA EVENTS. 


IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING A CROSS-DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY OR
ANY OF ITS SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES, THE LENDERS MAY TERMINATE THE COMMITMENTS MADE UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND DECLARE ANY PRINCIPAL AMOUNT THEN OUTSTANDING, AND ALL ACCRUED INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE CREDIT
AGREEMENT, TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE.  IN ADDITION TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS INDIVIDUAL UNCOMMITTED OR DISCRETIONARY LINES OF
CREDIT WITH A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN PARTIES TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY ALSO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH UNCOMMITTED OR DISCRETIONARY LINES OF CREDIT IN THE
FUTURE. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES, CERTAIN LENDERS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, OR THEIR AFFILIATES, PERFORM, OR MAY IN THE FUTURE PERFORM, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES, INCLUDING

PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH RELATIVE RETURN ON CAPITAL PERFORMANCE GOAL 
ON DECEMBER 17, 2015, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NATIONAL FUEL GAS COMPANY (THE COMPANY) MADE THE FOLLOWING
GRANTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH A PERFORMANCE GOAL RELATED TO RELATIVE RETURN ON CAPITAL (ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES) TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY: R. J. TANSKI, 45,079; D. P. BAUER, 3,423;
M. D. CABELL, 17,520; A. M. CELLINO, 11,089; AND J. R. PUSTULKA, 11,328. THE GRANTS WERE MADE UNDER THE COMPANYS 2010 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN (THE 2010 PLAN). A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES IS PROVIDED BELOW.  THE NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED TO A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS REFERRED TO AS
THE OFFICERS ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY. THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE FOR THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES IS OCTOBER 1, 2015 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. EACH ROC PERFORMANCE SHARE WILL MAKE THE OFFICER ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE, NO LATER THAN
MARCH 15, 2019 BUT IN ANY EVENT AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, UP TO TWO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EQUIVALENT VALUE IN CASH, AS
DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE), PROVIDED THAT THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL NOT VEST AND WILL BE FORFEITED TO THE EXTENT THE PERFORMANCE GOAL IS NOT ACHIEVED. NO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES. 
THE PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR THE OCTOBER 1, 2015 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 PERFORMANCE CYCLE IS THE COMPANYS TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL RELATIVE TO THE
TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL OF OTHER COMPANIES IN A GROUP SELECTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE REPORT GROUP). THE REPORT GROUP CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING COMPANIES: 
AGL RESOURCES INC.  ATMOS ENERGY
CORPORATION  CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION 
ENERGEN CORPORATION  EQT
CORPORATION  MDU RESOURCES GROUP INC. 
NATIONAL FUEL GAS COMPANY  NEW
JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  QUESTAR CORPORATION 
RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION  SM
ENERGY COMPANY  SOUTHWEST GAS CORPORATION 
UGI CORPORATION  ULTRA PETROLEUM
CORPORATION  WGL HOLDINGS INC. 
WHITING PETROLEUM CORPORATION 


TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL FOR A GIVEN COMPANY MEANS THE AVERAGE OF THE COMPANYS RETURNS ON CAPITAL FOR EACH
TWELVE MONTH PERIOD CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS DURING THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE, BASED ON DATA REPORTED FOR THE COMPANY IN THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE AT THE TIME OF ANALYSIS (OR, IF THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE CEASES TO BE
AVAILABLE, SUCH ALTERNATIVE PUBLICATION OR SERVICE AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE SHALL DESIGNATE).  THE NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT WILL VEST
AND BE PAID WILL DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE REPORT GROUP, AND NOT UPON THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF RETURN ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED FIVE PERCENTILE RANKINGS THAT WILL DETERMINE THE
NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID: (I) LESS THAN 45TH, (II) 45TH, (III) 60TH, (IV) 75TH, AND (V) 100TH. THESE PERCENTILE RANKINGS WILL RESULT IN VESTING AND
PAYMENT OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY, AS FOLLOWS: (I) 0%, (II) 50%, (III) 100%, (IV) 150%, AND (V) 200%, RESPECTIVELY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE WERE TO PLACE IT AT THE 60TH PERCENTILE OF THE REPORT GROUP, THEN 100% OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY WOULD VEST AND BE PAID. FOR PERFORMANCE BETWEEN TWO ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE LEVELS, THE PERCENTAGE OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES
TO VEST AND BE PAID WILL BE DETERMINED BY MATHEMATICAL INTERPOLATION. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE COMPANYS TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL IS NEGATIVE, THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY TO BE PAID WILL BE CAPPED AT 100%. ROC
PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT DO NOT VEST WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY FORFEITED WHEN THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAKES ITS DETERMINATION AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, BUT NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2019. 
PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN PERFORMANCE GOAL 
ON DECEMBER 17, 2015, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY MADE THE FOLLOWING GRANTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH A PERFORMANCE GOAL RELATED TO

PUSTULKA, 11,328. THE GRANTS WERE MADE UNDER THE 2010 PLAN. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES IS PROVIDED BELOW. 
THE NUMBER OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED TO A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS REFERRED TO AS THE OFFICERS TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY. THE
PERFORMANCE CYCLE FOR THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES IS OCTOBER 1, 2015 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. EACH TSR PERFORMANCE SHARE WILL MAKE THE OFFICER ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE, NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2019 BUT IN ANY EVENT AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE
AFTER THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, UP TO TWO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EQUIVALENT VALUE IN CASH, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE), PROVIDED THAT THE TSR
PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL NOT VEST AND WILL BE FORFEITED TO THE EXTENT THE PERFORMANCE GOAL IS NOT ACHIEVED. NO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES. 
THE PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR THE OCTOBER 1, 2015 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 PERFORMANCE CYCLE IS THE COMPANYS THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
RELATIVE TO THE THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE OTHER COMPANIES IN THE REPORT GROUP. THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN FOR A GIVEN COMPANY WILL BE BASED ON THE DATA REPORTED FOR THAT COMPANY (WITH THE STARTING AND ENDING STOCK




PRICES OVER THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE CALCULATED AS THE AVERAGE CLOSING STOCK PRICE FOR THE PRIOR CALENDAR MONTH AND WITH DIVIDENDS REINVESTED IN THAT COMPANYS SECURITIES AT EACH EX-DIVIDEND
DATE) IN THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE AT THE TIME OF ANALYSIS (OR, IF THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE CEASES TO BE AVAILABLE, SUCH ALTERNATIVE PUBLICATION OR SERVICE AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE SHALL DESIGNATE). 
THE NUMBER OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT WILL VEST AND BE PAID WILL DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE REPORT GROUP, AND NOT UPON THE
ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF RETURN ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED FIVE PERCENTILE RANKINGS THAT WILL DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID:
(I) 30TH OR BELOW, (II) 40TH, (III) 50TH, (IV) 70TH, AND (V) 90TH OR ABOVE. THESE PERCENTILE RANKINGS WILL RESULT IN VESTING AND PAYMENT OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY, AS
FOLLOWS: (I) 0%, (II) 50%, (III) 100%, (IV) 150%, AND (V) 200%, RESPECTIVELY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE WERE TO PLACE IT AT THE 50TH PERCENTILE OF THE
REPORT GROUP, THEN 100% OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY WOULD VEST AND BE PAID. FOR PERFORMANCE BETWEEN TWO ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE LEVELS, THE PERCENTAGE OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID WILL BE DETERMINED BY MATHEMATICAL INTERPOLATION.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE COMPANYS THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN IS NEGATIVE, THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY TO BE PAID WILL BE CAPPED AT 100%. TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT DO NOT VEST WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY
FORFEITED WHEN THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAKES ITS DETERMINATION AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, BUT NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2019.

ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.  ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2015, ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION (THE
COMPANY) ENTERED INTO A $1.25 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE CREDIT FACILITY) WITH CRÉDIT AGRICOLE CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANK AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (CRÉDIT AGRICOLE), MIZUHO BANK, LTD.
AS SYNDICATION AGENT AND A SYNDICATE OF 15 LENDERS IDENTIFIED THEREIN. THE CREDIT FACILITY REPLACES THE $1.25 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE PRIOR FACILITY) WITH THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND PLC AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, WHICH WAS
ENTERED INTO ON MAY 2, 2011, AND SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED, WHICH WAS SET TO EXPIRE ON AUGUST 22, 2019. THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AS THE PRIOR FACILITY, EXCEPT THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO TWICE EXTEND THE
FIVE YEAR TERM FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR. THE CREDIT FACILITY STILL CONTAINS THE REQUIREMENT THAT ALL BORROWINGS MUST BE REPAID WITHIN 364 DAYS AND THAT NO BORROWINGS CAN BE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR AT LEAST THIRTY
(30) CONSECUTIVE DAYS (CLEAN-UP PERIOD) DURING EACH FISCAL YEAR OF THE COMPANY, WITH THE TIMING OF THE CLEAN-UP PERIOD AT THE COMPANYS DISCRETION. THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS AN ACCORDION-TYPE FEATURE SIMILAR TO THE
PRIOR FACILITY, WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO PROPOSE UP TO A $250 MILLION INCREASE IN THE LENDERS COMMITMENT. THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. 
BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE DEPENDENT UPON THE COMPANYS CREDIT RATINGS AT THE TIME OF SUCH BORROWING AND BASED, AT
THE COMPANYS ELECTION, ON A BASE RATE OR LIBOR FOR THE APPLICABLE INTEREST PERIOD (ONE, TWO, THREE OR SIX MONTHS). IN THE CASE OF BORROWINGS BASED EITHER ON THE BASE RATE OR ON LIBOR, AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM 0.000% TO 1.250% PER
ANNUM WOULD BE ADDED, BASED ON THE COMPANYS THEN CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS. THE BASE RATE IS DEFINED AS THE HIGHEST OF (I) THE PER ANNUM RATE OF INTEREST ESTABLISHED BY CRÉDIT AGRICOLE AS ITS PRIME LENDING RATE AT THE TIME OF SUCH
BORROWING, (II) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE, AS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF BORROWING, PLUS ONE-HALF OF ONE PERCENT (0.50%) PER ANNUM, OR (III) THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS ONE PERCENT (1.00%). BASED ON THE CURRENT PRIME LENDING RATE CHARGED BY
CRÉDIT AGRICOLE, THE CURRENT FEDERAL FUNDS RATE, THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR AND THE COMPANYS CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS, BORROWINGS AT THE BASE RATE WOULD BEAR INTEREST AT 3.250% PER ANNUM, PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 0.000% PER ANNUM,
OR AN EFFECTIVE TOTAL INTEREST RATE OF 3.250% PER ANNUM. BASED UPON THE CURRENT LIBOR FOR A ONE-MONTH PERIOD AND THE COMPANYS CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS, BORROWINGS AT LIBOR WOULD BEAR INTEREST AT 0.193% PER ANNUM, PLUS AN APPLICABLE
MARGIN OF 1.000% PER ANNUM, OR AN EFFECTIVE TOTAL INTEREST RATE OF 1.193% PER ANNUM.  THE COMPANY MUST ALSO PAY COMMITMENT FEES QUARTERLY IN
ARREARS ON THE AVERAGE DAILY UNUSED PORTION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY AT RATES RANGING FROM 0.060% TO 0.175% PER ANNUM, DEPENDENT UPON THE COMPANYS CREDIT RATINGS. BASED UPON THE COMPANYS CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS, THE COMMITMENT FEE
WOULD BE AT THE RATE OF 0.100%.  THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL EXPIRE ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2020, AT WHICH TIME ALL OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS UNDER THE CREDIT
FACILITY WILL BE DUE AND PAYABLE. THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS USUAL AND CUSTOMARY COVENANTS FOR TRANSACTIONS OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING COVENANTS LIMITING LIENS, SUBSTANTIAL ASSET SALES AND MERGERS. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES THAT
DURING THE TERM OF THE FACILITY, THE COMPANYS DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION RATIO AS OF THE LAST DAY OF EACH OF ITS FISCAL QUARTERS SHALL BE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.70 TO 1.00, EXCLUDING FROM THE CALCULATION OF DEBT (I) ANY PENSION AND OTHER
POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS LIABILITY ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; AND (II) AN AMOUNT OF HYBRID SECURITIES, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY (GENERALLY, DEFERRABLE INTEREST SUBORDINATED DEBT
WITH A MATURITY OF AT LEAST 20 YEARS), NOT TO EXCEED A TOTAL OF 15% OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION.  IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE CREDIT
FACILITY, INCLUDING CROSS-DEFAULTS RELATING TO SPECIFIED OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF THE COMPANY, CRÉDIT AGRICOLE MAY, UPON THE CONSENT OF A CERTAIN MINIMUM NUMBER OF LENDERS, AND SHALL, UPON THE REQUEST AND DIRECTION OF SUCH LENDERS, TERMINATE THE
COMMITMENTS MADE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, DECLARE THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, INCLUDING ALL ACCRUED INTEREST AND UNPAID FEES, PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY, AND ENFORCE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS AND INTERESTS CREATED AND EXISTING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY DOCUMENTS,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL RIGHTS OF SET-OFF AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS AVAILABLE UNDER THE LAW. FOR CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT RELATING TO INSOLVENCY, BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVERSHIP, THE COMMITMENTS ARE AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATED AND THE AMOUNTS
OUTSTANDING AUTOMATICALLY BECOME PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY.  WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER PARTIES TO THE CREDIT FACILITY, SOME OF WHOM WERE ALSO PARTIES TO THE
PRIOR FACILITY DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY ALSO HAS OR MAY HAVE HAD CUSTOMARY BANKING RELATIONSHIPS BASED ON THE PROVISION OF A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES, INCLUDING CASH MANAGEMENT, INVESTMENT BANKING, AND EQUIPMENT FINANCING AND LEASING

OTHER EVENTSON MARCH 30, 2016, THE INDIANA UTILITY REGULATORY COMMISSION (IURC) ISSUED AN ORDER RE-APPROVING THE MAJORITY OF VECTREN ENERGY DELIVERY OF INDIANA’S (VECTREN) GAS INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION PROJECTS REQUESTED IN THE THIRD UPDATE OF ITS ORIGINAL SEVEN-YEAR PLAN (PLAN) APPROVED IN 2014. VECTREN - THROUGH ITS TWO GAS UTILITIES IN THE STATE, VECTREN ENERGY DELIVERY OF INDIANA - NORTH AND VECTREN ENERGY DELIVERY OF INDIANA - SOUTH, IS INVESTING MORE THAN $950 MILLION IN PIPELINE REPLACEMENT AND SYSTEM INTEGRITY MAINTENANCE WORK TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF SERVICE PROVIDED TO ITS 690,000 CUSTOMERS IN INDIANA. THROUGH THE MARCH 30 ORDER, APPROXIMATELY $890 MILLION HAS BEEN APPROVED THROUGH THE RECOVERY MECHANISMS SUPPORTING THESE FILINGS. EVERY SIX MONTHS DURING THE PLAN PERIOD, THE UTILITY IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE UPDATED DETAILS OF THE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS INCLUDED IN THE PLAN. THESE FILINGS DETAIL PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND PROJECTS TO BE COMPLETED IN THE COMING YEAR. THESE FILINGS ALSO INCLUDE COST ESTIMATE UPDATES. IN THE PLAN UPDATE FILED IN OCTOBER 2015 AND APPROVED WEDNESDAY, VECTREN PROPOSED TO INCLUDE CERTAIN NEW PROJECTS THAT HAVE EMERGED AS A RESULT OF ITS ONGOING RISK ANALYSIS.SPECIFICALLY, ONE PROJECT THAT WAS EXCLUDED FOR RECOVERY UNDER THE PLAN IS A 20-MILE TRANSMISSION LINE INSTALLATION AND OTHER RELATED INVESTMENTS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMER GROWTH AND ONGOING SYSTEM RELIABILITY IN THE LAFAYETTE, IND., AREA. THE IURC STATED BECAUSE THE PROJECT WAS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL PLAN FILED IN 2013, IT DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR COST RECOVERY UNDER THIS LAW. THE IURC DID GRANT APPROVAL TO MOVE FORWARD AND PRE-APPROVED THE PROJECT FOR RATE BASE INCLUSION UPON THE FILING OF VECTREN NORTH’S NEXT RATE CASE.VECTREN IS EVALUATING ITS OPTIONS RELATED TO THE IURC’S DECISION TO NOT ALLOW NEW PROJECTS TO BE INCLUDED IN ITS PLAN, INCLUDING AN APPEAL OF THE IURC’S ORDER ON THIS ISSUE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE EXPECTED THAT NEW PROJECTS WILL EMERGE AS UPDATED RISK ASSESSMENTS DETERMINE THAT NEW PROJECTS, SOME OF WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY NOT IDENTIFIED, ARE REQUIRED. VECTREN HAS 30 DAYS TO APPEAL THE ORDER FROM THE DATE ON WHICH IT IS ISSUED.IN ANOTHER MATTER, ON MARCH 23, 2016, THE IURC ISSUED AN ORDER APPROVING VECTREN’S 2016-2017 ELECTRIC ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE OFFERED TO ITS 144,000 ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS IN SOUTHWESTERN INDIANA. THE PROGRAMS APPROVED WILL YIELD 74 MILLION KILOWATT HOURS OF ENERGY SAVINGS OVER THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD. THE ORDER PROVIDES FOR COST RECOVERY OF PROGRAM AND ADMINISTRATIVE NEEDS AND INCLUDES PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES FOR REACHING ENERGY SAVINGS GOALS.  THE ORDER ALSO INCLUDED A LOST MARGIN RECOVERY MECHANISM THAT NOW LIMITS THAT RECOVERY TO FOUR YEARS OR THE LIFE OF THE INSTALLED ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURE (WHICHEVER IS SHORTER). PREVIOUS ELECTRIC ENERGY EFFICIENCY ORDERS HAD NOT CALLED FOR THIS FOUR-YEAR LOST MARGIN CAP. THIS RULING FOLLOWS TWO OTHER RECENT IURC DECISIONS IMPLEMENTING THE SAME RECOVERY CAP WITH RESPECT TO OTHER ELECTRIC UTILITIES IN INDIANA. VECTREN IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO PROMOTE AND DRIVE PARTICIPATION IN ITS 2016-2017 ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS AND BEYOND AND IS THEREFORE CONSIDERING AN APPEAL OF THIS LOST MARGIN RECOVERY RESTRICTION.

THE TIME-VESTED STOCK RIGHTS WOULD VEST IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER: (I) 33% ON MARCH 7, 2020; (II) 34% ON MARCH 7, 2021; AND (III) 33% ON MARCH 7, 2022. EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD OPPORTUNITY (AT THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM LEVELS) IS BASED ON HIS OR HER JANUARY 1, 2016 BASE SALARY.  FOR THE COMPANY’S CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE AWARD OPPORTUNITIES RANGE FROM 78.75% TO 315%.  FOR THE COMPANY’S EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, THE AWARD OPPORTUNITIES RANGE FROM 38.5% TO 154%.  FOR THE COMPANY’S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENTS, THE AWARD OPPORTUNITIES RANGE FROM 26.25% TO 126%.AWARD OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK RIGHTS COMPONENT OF THE LTIP ARE 67.5% OF BASE SALARY FOR THE CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, 33% OF BASE SALARY FOR THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND 22.5% TO 27% OF BASE SALARY FOR THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENTS, RESPECTIVELY.  IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTED STOCK RIGHTS ACTUALLY GRANTED TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WILL DEPEND ON THEIR BASE SALARY AND THE PER SHARE PRICE OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE, WHICH IS ANTICIPATED TO BE IN EARLY MARCH 2019. AS NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY’S LEVEL OF ATTAINMENT (THRESHOLD, TARGET OR MAXIMUM) OF EACH OF THE RELATIVE TSR GOAL, THE FFO/DEBT RATIO GOAL AND THE EARNINGS GROWTH GOAL OVER THE LTIP PERFORMANCE PERIOD WILL DETERMINE EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S ACTUAL PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD.  SUCH GOALS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW:•“RELATIVE TSR GOAL” REFERS TO THE COMPANY’S TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (“TSR”) FOR THE LTIP PERFORMANCE PERIOD AS COMPARED TO THE TSR OF THE OTHER UTILITIES INCLUDED IN THE S&P 400 MID-CAP UTILITY INDEX.  FOR THIS PURPOSE, TSR WILL BE MEASURED BY COMPARING THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK (OR THE OTHER UTILITIES’ COMMON STOCK) FOR THE 20 TRADING DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE BEGINNING OF THE LTIP PERFORMANCE PERIOD WITH THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE FOR THE LAST 20 TRADING DAYS OF THE LTIP PERFORMANCE PERIOD.  TSR WILL BE DETERMINED BY ADDING ANY DIVIDENDS PAID BY THE COMPANY (OR OTHER UTILITIES) TO THE APPRECIATION IN VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S (OR OTHER UTILITIES’) COMMON STOCK.•“FFO/DEBT RATIO GOAL” REFERS TO THE COMPANY’S FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018, DIVIDED BY THE COMPANY’S TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING (INCLUDING ANY LONG-TERM LEASES AND  UNFUNDED PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ARE EQUAL TO THE COMPANY’S NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AS REPORTED IN THE COMPANY’S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN ITEMS.  THE CALCULATION IS INTENDED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.’S (“MOODY’S”) CALCULATION OF FFO/DEBT (WHICH MOODY’S REFERS TO AS “CFO PRE-WC/DEBT”) AND IF MOODY’S MODIFIES ITS CALCULATION METHODOLOGY PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND COMMUNICATES SUCH CHANGES IN WRITING TO COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE MOODY’S CALCULATION METHODOLOGY IN EFFECT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 WILL BE UTILIZED.•“EARNINGS GROWTH GOAL” REFERS, FOR THE LTIP PERFORMANCE PERIOD, TO THE COMPANY’S COMPOUNDED ANNUAL GROWTH IN EARNINGS PER SHARE (AS DEFINED IN THE LTIP, WHICH DEFINITION IS IDENTICAL TO THE DEFINITION USED FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING INCENTIVE EPS UNDER THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN), MEASURED BY DIVIDING THE EARNINGS PER SHARE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 BY THE EARNINGS PER SHARE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015.  THE RESULTING EARNINGS GROWTH MULTIPLE WILL THEN BE MULTIPLIED TO THE 1/3 POWER AND SUBTRACT 1.AMENDMENT OF EXECUTIVE SAVINGS PLAN II ON FEBRUARY 24, 2016, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE APPROVED A FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE PNM RESOURCES, INC. EXECUTIVE SAVINGS PLAN II (THE “ESP II”). THE FIRST AMENDMENT CHANGES THE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE SUPPLEMENTAL CREDITS FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ESP II WHO BECOME ELIGIBLE OFFICERS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2016.PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT, THE SUPPLEMENTAL CREDITS WERE INTENDED TO REPLACE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF AN ELIGIBLE OFFICER’S PRE-RETIREMENT INCOME.  SUCH AN APPROACH WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TO THE CALCULATION OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL CREDITS FOR AN ELIGIBLE OFFICER WHO WAS PARTICIPATING IN THE ESP II PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2016.FOR PARTICIPANTS WHO BECOME ELIGIBLE OFFICERS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2016, THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR (I.E., THE COMPANY, WHICH ACTS THROUGH ITS SENIOR HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICER), WITH THE ADVANCE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, WILL DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF SUPPLEMENTAL CREDITS BASED ON THE MARKET CONDITIONS AS OF THE DATE THAT THE ELIGIBLE OFFICER IS HIRED OR BECOMES ELIGIBLE FOR A SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT.  THE SUPPLEMENTAL CREDITS WILL BE EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE ELIGIBLE OFFICER’S CURRENT COMPENSATION AND WILL NOT REPLACE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE ELIGIBLE OFFICER’S PRE-RETIREMENT INCOME.THE ESP II DEFINES ELIGIBLE OFFICER AS A PARTICIPANT WHO (1) OCCUPIES THE POSITION OF SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OR HIGHER OF PNM RESOURCES, (2) HAS COMPLETED AT LEAST THREE MONTHS OF SERVICE AND (3) HAS BEEN SELECTED BY THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR WITH THE ADVANCE CONSENT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE TO RECEIVE A SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT.APPROVAL BY THE FULL BOARD WAS NOT REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE ESP II. NOTE REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESCERTAIN PERFORMANCE MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE (INCLUDING INCENTIVE EPS UNDER THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN AND TSR, FFO/DEBT AND EARNINGS PER SHARE UNDER THE LTIP) ARE NOT FINANCIAL MEASURES DETERMINED UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (“GAAP”).  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED SOLELY FOR PURPOSES OF MEASURING PERFORMANCE UNDER THE APPLICABLE PLAN OR ARRANGEMENT.  SUCH MEASURES (AND ANY CORRESPONDING TARGETS) HAVE NO EFFECT ON, AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY IDENTICAL TO, ANY EARNINGS GUIDANCE THAT MAY BE ANNOUNCED BY THE COMPANY.  CONSISTENT WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THE COMPANY’S PAST PRACTICE, THE COMPANY’S DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENTS FOR FUTURE ANNUAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS WILL INCLUDE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT HOW SUCH PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE CALCULATED, AS WELL AS ANY REQUIRED RECONCILIATION(S) TO CORRESPONDING GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE(S).",PNM

THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE COMPANY'S PRESS RELEASE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP"").  A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS.  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP.  MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE COMPANY'S PRESS RELEASE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP"").  A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS, INCLUDING  THOSE USED FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AND CERTAIN NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS.  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP.  SINCE THE FUTURE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GAAP AND ONGOING EARNINGS ARE FREQUENTLY OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR FORECASTED ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

ENERGY AND THE STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS IN PURSUING A TRANSACTION WITH WESTAR AND THE POTENTIAL TERMS OF AN INITIAL PROPOSAL TO WESTAR, IN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT ACTIVITY IN THE UTILITY MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS MARKET AND THE GENERAL TERMS OF RECENT
TRANSACTIONS. REPRESENTATIVES OF GOLDMAN SACHS REVIEWED ITS PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL ANALYSES OF A POTENTIAL TRANSACTION. FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND REVIEW, THE GREAT PLAINS ENERGY BOARD AUTHORIZED MR. BASSHAM TO DISCUSS A PRELIMINARY PROPOSAL WITH
MR. RUELLE THAT WOULD BE BASED ON AN ACQUISITION OF WESTAR BY GREAT PLAINS ENERGY AT A PREMIUM OF 20%-25% OVER THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE OF WESTARS SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, WITH CONSIDERATION PAYABLE 70% IN GREAT PLAINS ENERGY COMMON STOCK
AND 30% IN CASH. THE GREAT PLAINS ENERGY PROPOSAL CONTEMPLATED A COMBINATION OF THE EXECUTIVE TEAMS FROM WESTAR AND GREAT PLAINS ENERGY WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR PARTICIPATION ON THE GREAT PLAINS ENERGY BOARD BY SOME CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE WESTAR BOARD
FOLLOWING THE CLOSING. THE GREAT PLAINS ENERGY PROPOSAL DID NOT DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF THE CONTEMPLATED EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAMS OR GREAT PLAINS ENERGY BOARD.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN THE UTILITY INDUSTRY, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS ANNOUNCED IN 2015, AND THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR WESTAR. TOPICS OF DISCUSSION INCLUDED THE RELATIVE VALUATIONS OF UTILITIES, GENERALLY, AND HOW FUTURE CHANGES IN INTEREST
RATES AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD AFFECT VALUES. IN PARTICULAR, DISCUSSION WAS HAD REGARDING HOW, IN GENERAL, AS INTEREST RATES RISE, VALUATIONS OF UTILITY COMPANIES CAN DECREASE AND, SIMILARLY, AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY INCREASES, VALUATIONS OF UTILITY
COMPANIES CAN DECREASE. ALSO DISCUSSED WERE POSSIBLE APPROACHES TO ASCERTAINING POTENTIAL VALUE WESTAR MIGHT OBTAIN FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD IT CONSIDER A STRATEGIC TRANSACTION.

MEETING, GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES CONTACTED GREAT PLAINS ENERGY, BIDDER B AND 14 OTHER COMPANIES REGARDING A POSSIBLE TRANSACTION. ALL BUT TWO OF THE COMPANIES CONTACTED WERE STRATEGIC BUYERS BECAUSE WESTAR BELIEVED, BASED ON ITS EXPERIENCE AND THAT OF
ITS ADVISORS, THAT IN THE CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT FINANCIAL BIDDERS WOULD LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE OFFERS IN THE SAME RANGE AS THE STRATEGIC BUYERS BECAUSE FINANCIAL BUYERS TODAY GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER THRESHOLD RATES OF RETURNS FOR
INVESTMENTS. OF THE CONTACTED COMPANIES, GREAT PLAINS ENERGY, BIDDER B AND 7 OTHERS ENTERED INTO CONFIDENTIALITY AND STANDSTILL AGREEMENTS WITH WESTAR THAT CONTAINED SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, INCLUDING STANDSTILL PROVISIONS THAT INCLUDED A
PROHIBITION ON REQUESTING A WAIVER OF THE STANDSTILL PROVISIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE 16 COMPANIES CONTACTED BY GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, WESTAR AND GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES RECEIVED INQUIRIES FROM ONE NON-STRATEGIC BUYER WITH PRIOR INVOLVEMENT IN UTILITY
TRANSACTIONS WHO WAS UNWILLING TO SIGN A CONFIDENTIALITY AND STANDSTILL AGREEMENT AND, THEREFORE, WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE PROCESS. THE PARTIES THAT ENTERED INTO CONFIDENTIALITY AND STANDSTILL AGREEMENTS WERE PROVIDED WITH A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
PACKAGE THAT INCLUDED INFORMATION REGARDING WESTAR, INCLUDING ITS 2016 INTERNAL FINANCIAL FORECAST. THIS FORECAST WAS THE SAME FORECAST PROVIDED TO GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES FOR PURPOSES OF ITS FAIRNESS OPINION. WESTARS MANAGEMENT TEAM ALSO HELD
CONFERENCE CALLS WITH GREAT PLAINS ENERGY, BIDDER B AND 5 OF THE OTHER COMPANIES TO DISCUSS WESTARS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AS WELL AS ITS ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS REFLECTED IN ITS FORECAST. THE OTHER TWO COMPANIES THAT
HAD SIGNED CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS DECIDED NOT TO SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT DUE DILIGENCE CALLS. REPRESENTATIVES OF WESTAR AND GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES ALSO HELD FOLLOW-UP CALLS WITH THREE OF THE BIDDERS AFTER THE CALLS WITH WESTAR MANAGEMENT TO DISCUSS
FINANCIAL ISSUES AND WESTARS FORECASTS IN MORE DETAIL.

INCLUDING PRICE AND OTHER RELEVANT TERMS AND CONDITIONS. AFTER DISCUSSING THE INDICATIONS OF INTEREST AND THE PROS AND CONS OF MOVING FORWARD WITH DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING A POTENTIAL TRANSACTION, THE WESTAR BOARD DECIDED TO SEEK DEFINITIVE PROPOSALS
FROM ALL FIVE COMPANIES THAT HAD SUBMITTED INDICATIONS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING GREAT PLAINS ENERGY. EACH OF THESE COMPANIES WAS GIVEN ACCESS TO AN ELECTRONIC DATA ROOM CONTAINING DETAILED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT WESTAR, OFFERED AN IN-PERSON
MANAGEMENT PRESENTATION REGARDING WESTARS BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS, AND ADVISED OF THE PROCESS AND SCHEDULE FOR SUBMITTING DEFINITIVE PROPOSALS. IN THE COURSE OF ADVISING GREAT PLAINS ENERGY THAT IT WAS BEING INVITED TO SUBMIT A
DEFINITIVE PROPOSAL, A REPRESENTATIVE OF GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES PROVIDED FEEDBACK REGARDING GREAT PLAINS ENERGYS INITIAL PROPOSAL THAT WESTAR WOULD PREFER A BID WITH A LARGER PROPORTION OF THE CONSIDERATION CONSISTING OF CASH BECAUSE WESTAR
VIEWED AN OFFER CONSISTING OF MORE CASH TO HAVE GREATER CERTAINTY OF VALUE THAN ONE CONSISTING OF MORE STOCK.

ON MAY 23, 2016, THE DEADLINE SET BY WESTAR FOR SUBMISSION OF DEFINITIVE WRITTEN PROPOSALS,
GREAT PLAINS ENERGY AND BIDDERS D AND E SUBMITTED WRITTEN PROPOSALS TO ACQUIRE WESTAR, WHICH PROPOSALS WERE MORE FAVORABLE THAN PREVIOUS PROPOSALS FROM GREAT PLAINS ENERGY, BIDDER D AND BIDDER E, PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THE BIDDERS HAD RECEIVED ACCESS TO
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION RELATED TO WESTAR. GREAT PLAINS ENERGY SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL TO ACQUIRE WESTAR FOR A PRICE OF $58.25 PER SHARE, WITH 85% OF THE CONSIDERATION BEING IN CASH AND 15% IN GREAT PLAINS ENERGY COMMON STOCK. GREAT PLAINS
ENERGYS PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDED A COLLAR MECHANISM ON THE STOCK PORTION OF THE CONSIDERATION PURSUANT TO WHICH THE EXCHANGE RATIO OF THE STOCK WOULD BE ADJUSTED WITHIN A RANGE OF 7.5% ABOVE AND BELOW GREAT PLAINS ENERGYS
THEN-CURRENT STOCK PRICE TO PROVIDE WESTAR SHAREHOLDERS WITH A FIXED VALUE FOR THE STOCK PORTION OF THE CONSIDERATION SO LONG AS GREAT PLAINS ENERGYS STOCK PRICE WAS WITHIN THE RANGE SPECIFIED IN THE COLLAR. GREAT PLAINS ENERGY ALSO SUBMITTED
A FORM OF MERGER AGREEMENT AND COMMITMENT LETTER WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING FOR ITS PROPOSAL TO ACQUIRE WESTAR. BIDDER D PROPOSED TO ACQUIRE WESTAR FOR A PRICE OF BETWEEN $54.00 AND $56.00, WITH 45% OF THE CONSIDERATION BEING IN CASH AND 55%
BEING IN COMMON STOCK OF BIDDER D. BIDDER D DID NOT PROPOSE A COLLAR OR OTHER FORM OF PRICE PROTECTION WITH RESPECT TO THE STOCK PORTION OF THE CONSIDERATION. BIDDER D NOTED THAT BECAUSE OF EXOGENOUS CIRCUMSTANCES UNRELATED TO WESTAR, BIDDER D HAD
NOT HAD SUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLETE A MARK-UP OF THE FORM OF MERGER AGREEMENT OR OBTAIN A FINANCING COMMITMENT LETTER. BIDDER D INDICATED THAT IT WAS PREPARED TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO COMPLETE THE NECESSARY DEFINITIVE DOCUMENTATION RELATING TO ITS
BID. BIDDER E PROPOSED TO ACQUIRE WESTAR FOR A PRICE OF $51.00 PER SHARE WITH 80% OF THE CONSIDERATION IN COMMON STOCK OF BIDDER E AND 20% IN CASH. BIDDER E DID NOT PROPOSE ANY COLLAR OR OTHER FORM OF PRICE PROTECTION ON THE STOCK PORTION OF THE
CONSIDERATION IN ITS PROPOSAL. BIDDER E SUBMITTED A FORM OF MERGER AGREEMENT WITH ITS BID AND INDICATED THAT IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE OUTSIDE FINANCING FOR THE CASH PORTION OF ITS BID. NEITHER THE WESTAR BOARD NOR ANY MEMBERS OF WESTARS EXECUTIVE
MANAGEMENT TEAM DISCUSSED THE CONSIDERATION PROPOSED BY GREAT PLAINS ENERGY, BIDDER D AND BIDDER E DIRECTLY WITH THE BIDDERS UPON RECEIPT OF THE PROPOSALS. BIDDER F PROVIDED AN ORAL INDICATION OF CONTINUED INTEREST, STATING THAT IT WOULD BE
INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING WESTAR FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $52.00 PER SHARE IN CASH, BUT THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TIME TO OBTAIN COMMITTED FINANCING AND NEGOTIATE A DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT.

COMMON STOCK OF BIDDER D. BIDDER D INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO INCREASE ITS BID EVEN FURTHER IF IT WERE ABLE TO FIND ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF VALUE FOLLOWING FURTHER DILIGENCE ON WESTAR. BIDDER D DID NOT DESCRIBE THE ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF VALUE
IN DETAIL. BIDDER D SUBSEQUENTLY CONFIRMED THESE CHANGES TO ITS BID IN A WRITTEN LETTER TO WESTAR DELIVERED ON MAY 27, 2016.

ALSO ON MAY 29, 2016, THE WESTAR BOARD MET, WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF WESTAR SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES AND BAKER BOTTS
PRESENT, TO CONSIDER THE UPDATED BIDS FROM GREAT PLAINS ENERGY AND BIDDER D. BAKER BOTTS PROVIDED THE WESTAR BOARD WITH LEGAL ADVICE RELATING TO THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF DIRECTORS IN MERGER AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS. MANAGEMENT, GUGGENHEIM
SECURITIES AND BAKER BOTTS UPDATED THE WESTAR BOARD WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPROVED TERMS OF THE BIDS, INCLUDING THAT GREAT PLAINS ENERGY HAD AGREED TO INCREASE ITS PRICE AND HAD AGREED TO CHANGES TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT REQUESTED BY WESTAR, AND THAT
BIDDER D HAD INCREASED ITS PRICE TO THE HIGH END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY INDICATED RANGE AND INDICATED THAT IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO INCREASE ITS PRICE FURTHER BASED ON ADDITIONAL DILIGENCE ON WESTAR. BIDDER D DID NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON ITS
ADDITIONAL DILIGENCE REQUESTS. THE WESTAR BOARD NOTED THAT THE INDICATIVE PRICE OF $60.00 PER SHARE OF WESTAR COMMON STOCK PROPOSED BY GREAT PLAINS ENERGY WAS $4.00 HIGHER THAN THE PRICE THEN PROPOSED BY BIDDER D, THAT BIDDER D HAD INDICATED THAT IT
MIGHT BE ABLE TO INCREASE ITS PRICE FURTHER BUT THAT THERE WAS NO ASSURANCE THAT BIDDER D WOULD INCREASE ITS PRICE AND THAT ANY PRICE INCREASE IF IT DID OCCUR COULD BE LESS THAN $4.00 PER SHARE. THE WESTAR BOARD ALSO NOTED THAT GREAT PLAINS ENERGY
HAD OBTAINED FULLY COMMITTED FINANCING FOR THE CASH PORTION OF ITS PROPOSAL. GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES INFORMED THE WESTAR BOARD THAT THE INDICATIVE PRICE OF $60.00 PROPOSED BY GREAT PLAINS ENERGY REPRESENTED A 13.4% PREMIUM TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF
WESTAR COMMON STOCK ON MAY 27, 2016, AND A 36.1% PREMIUM TO WESTARS UNDISTURBED CLOSING SHARE PRICE OF $44.08 AS OF MARCH 9, 2016, WHICH WAS THE LAST TRADING DAY BEFORE AN ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED STATING THAT WESTAR MIGHT BE IN THE
EARLY STAGES OF EXPLORING STRATEGIC OPTIONS THAT COULD LEAD TO A SALE, AND A MULTIPLE OF 



PROJECTED EARNINGS CONSISTENT WITH OR FAVORABLE TO RECENT UTILITY ACQUISITION AGREEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS REVIEWED BY GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES. THE WESTAR BOARD ALSO NOTED
THAT GREAT PLAINS ENERGY HAD AGREED TO INCREASE THE FEES PAYABLE TO WESTAR IN THE EVENT THE MERGER AGREEMENT WERE TO BE TERMINATED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND REDUCE THE FEES PAYABLE BY WESTAR IN THE EVENT THE AGREEMENT WERE TO BE TERMINATED BY
WESTAR UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ALL AS NOTED ABOVE. THE WESTAR BOARD ALSO NOTED THAT GREAT PLAINS ENERGY HAD PRESERVED THE PRICE PROTECTION IN THE FORM OF A COLLAR ON THE STOCK PORTION OF THE CONSIDERATION IN ITS OFFER AND HAD OFFERED TO INCLUDE
ONE MEMBER OF THE WESTAR BOARD ON THE GREAT PLAINS ENERGY BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOLLOWING CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER. FINALLY, THE WESTAR BOARD ALSO CONSIDERED THAT WESTAR WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE MERGER AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO ACCEPT AN
ALTERNATIVE ACQUISITION PROPOSAL UPON SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PAYMENT TO GREAT PLAINS ENERGY OF A FEE OF $280 MILLION. THE WESTAR BOARD ALSO CONSIDERED THAT GREAT PLAINS ENERGY HAD AGREED TO MAINTAIN WESTARS CORPORATE
HEADQUARTERS IN TOPEKA, KANSAS, WHICH MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO A FINDING BY REGULATORS THAT THE TRANSACTION WOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.

THE SECTION OF THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS ENTITLED THE PROPOSED MERGERRECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WESTAR BOARD AND ITS REASONS FOR THE MERGER THAT BEGINS ON PAGE 77 OF THE
JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS HEREBY SUPPLEMENTED AS FOLLOWS: REPLACE THE SECOND BULLET POINT ON PAGE 79 WITH THE FOLLOWING:   


 

 
THE WESTAR BOARDS BELIEF THAT THE MERGER SHOULD OVER TIME GENERATE COST SAVINGS AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES THROUGH CONSOLIDATION AND INTEGRATION OF CERTAIN FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE JOINING OF WESTAR AND GREAT
PLAINS ENERGY ALLOWS FOR GREATER OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE EFFICIENCIES THAN IF WESTAR WERE TO REMAIN ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS BECAUSE THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL BE LARGER AND CONSEQUENTLY WILL OFFER GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR SYNERGIES.

ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.  ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2016, NATIONAL FUEL GAS COMPANY (THE
COMPANY) ENTERED INTO A THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE FOLLOWING LENDERS: JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION; BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.; HSBC BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION; WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION; CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE, NEW YORK BRANCH; CITIZENS BANK, N.A.; U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION; M&T BANK; PNC BANK,
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION; BRANCH BANKING AND TRUST COMPANY; FIRST NIAGARA BANK; KEYBANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION; THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON; AND COMERICA BANK. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES A $750 MILLION MULTI-YEAR UNSECURED COMMITTED REVOLVING CREDIT
FACILITY THROUGH DECEMBER 5, 2019, PLUS A $500 MILLION 364-DAY UNSECURED COMMITTED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THROUGH SEPTEMBER 8, 2017. WITH RESPECT TO BORROWINGS UNDER THE MULTI-YEAR FACILITY, THE COMPANY IS PERMITTED (BUT NOT REQUIRED)
TO ELECT A MATURITY DATE THAT IS 364 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE BORROWING. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES AN OPTION FOR THE COMPANY TO REQUEST INCREASES IN THE AGGREGATE MULTI-YEAR COMMITMENTS TO AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $850 MILLION, SUBJECT TO
CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY MAY USE THE PROCEEDS OF LOANS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER (I) ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, (II) OTHER SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES AND (III) MATURING LONG-TERM
DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND OTHER LAWFUL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDS AND
RESTATES THAT CERTAIN SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY IN SEPTEMBER 2015. THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THAT AGREEMENT. 
RATES FOR BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANYS CREDIT RATINGS AND ARE BASED, AT THE COMPANYS ELECTION, UPON WHETHER
THE BORROWING IS A EURODOLLAR LOAN OR AN ALTERNATE BASE RATE LOAN. EURODOLLAR LOANS WILL BEAR INTEREST AT AN ADJUSTED LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED (LIBO) RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM 0.80% TO 1.525%, DEPENDING ON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE
COMPANY. ALTERNATE BASE RATE LOANS WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO THE SUM OF (1) THE GREATEST OF (A) THE PRIME RATE, (B) THE FEDERAL FUNDS EFFECTIVE RATE PLUS 1/2 OF 1%, AND (C) AN ADJUSTED LIBO RATE FOR A
ONE-MONTH INTEREST PERIOD PLUS 1%, AND (2) AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM 0% TO 0.525%, DEPENDING ON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AGREES TO PAY THE LENDERS A FACILITY
FEE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THE FACILITY FEE RATE IS DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE COMPANY AND RANGES FROM A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO 0.075% TO 0.225% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. BASED ON THE COMPANYS CURRENT
CREDIT RATINGS, THE FACILITY FEE RATE WOULD BE 0.15% PER ANNUM. 


THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS REPRESENTATIONS AND AFFIRMATIVE, NEGATIVE AND FINANCIAL COVENANTS USUAL AND
CUSTOMARY FOR AGREEMENTS OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS COVENANTS THAT PLACE CONDITIONS UPON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH OTHER COMPANIES, SELL ANY MATERIAL PART OF ITS BUSINESS OR PROPERTY, AND INCUR LIENS. THE
CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES A COVENANT THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT PERMIT ITS DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION RATIO TO EXCEED 0.675 AT THE LAST DAY OF ANY FISCAL QUARTER THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2017, OR 0.65 AT THE LAST DAY OF ANY FISCAL QUARTER THEREAFTER.
IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS A CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISION WHEREBY THE FAILURE BY THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER OTHER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AGGREGATING $40.0 MILLION OR MORE, OR THE OCCURRENCE
OF CERTAIN EVENTS AFFECTING THOSE OTHER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS, COULD TRIGGER AN OBLIGATION TO REPAY ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS ADDITIONAL CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, PAYMENT DEFAULTS, MATERIAL INACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, COVENANT DEFAULTS, CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY EVENTS, CERTAIN JUDGMENT DEFAULTS AND CERTAIN ERISA EVENTS. 
IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING A CROSS-DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES, THE
LENDERS MAY TERMINATE THE COMMITMENTS MADE UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND DECLARE ANY PRINCIPAL AMOUNT THEN OUTSTANDING, AND ALL ACCRUED INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE.
 IN ADDITION TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS INDIVIDUAL UNCOMMITTED OR DISCRETIONARY LINES OF CREDIT WITH A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN PARTIES TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY ALSO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH UNCOMMITTED OR DISCRETIONARY LINES OF CREDIT IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY
COURSE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES, CERTAIN LENDERS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, OR THEIR AFFILIATES, PERFORM, OR MAY IN THE FUTURE PERFORM, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES, INCLUDING INVESTMENT BANKING, UNDERWRITING, LENDING,

THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE COMPANY'S PRESS RELEASE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP"").  A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP. MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

IF APPROVED, THE AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO NET INCOME WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION -- $17.1 MILLION FOR HECO, $3.4 MILLION FOR HELCO, AND $3.2 MILLION FOR MECO.  REMAINING RECOVERABLE COSTS OF $52 MILLION WOULD BE INCLUDED IN RATE BASE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012.

IN DECIDING TO ENTER INTO THE AGREEMENT, HECO, HELCO, AND MECO TOOK INTO ACCOUNT A NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING (1) THE SIGNIFICANT PASSAGE OF TIME SINCE THE INITIAL COSTS FOR THE CIP CT-1 AND CIS PROJECTS WERE INCURRED, (2) THE UNCERTAIN TIMING AND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BY THE PUC, HECO AND OTHER PARTIES TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND MEANINGFUL REGULATORY AUDIT OF PROJECT COSTS FOR CIP CT-1 AND CIS, (3) THE ADDITIONAL CARRYING CHARGES THAT WOULD BE ACCRUED TO THE PROJECT COST FOR BOTH CIP CT-1 AND CIS, (4) RESOLVING THE REGULATORY AUDITS, (5) THE NEED TO ALLOW THE PUC, THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE, HECO, HELCO AND MECO TO FOCUS THEIR RESOURCES ON THE NUMEROUS PRIORITIES THEY FACE IN IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TRANSFORMING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY IN HAWAII FROM ONE BASED ON OIL-FIRED GENERATION TO ONE BASED ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND HAWAIIS INDIGENOUS RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES, AND (6) THE CONCERN FOR THE CURRENT HIGH ELECTRIC BILLS DUE TO THE HIGH FUEL COSTS.
 
MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT OR PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES CONCERNING THE APPROVAL OR TIMING OF APPROVAL OF THE AGREEMENT BY THE PUC.

THE FOLLOWING IS AN UPDATE TO THE DISCLOSURE UNDER SUBSEQUENT EVENT IN HEIS NOTE 3 AND HECOS NOTE 16 OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, IN HEIS AND HECOS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN THEIR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012.
 
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ON JANUARY 28, 2013, HECO, HAWAII ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY, INC. (HELCO), MAUI ELECTRIC COMPANY, LIMITED (MECO) (THE COMPANIES) AND THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE, SIGNED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT (AGREEMENT) TO WRITE-OFF $40 MILLION OF COSTS IN LIEU OF CONDUCTING THE REGULATORY AUDITS OF THE CAMPBELL INDUSTRIAL PARK COMBUSTION TURBINE UNIT NO. 1 (CIP CT-1) PROJECT AND THE CUSTOMER INFORMATION SYSTEM (CIS) PROJECT. BASED ON THE AGREEMENT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANIES RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION -- $17.1 MILLION FOR HECO, $3.4 MILLION FOR HELCO, AND $3.2 MILLION FOR MECO. THE REMAINING RECOVERABLE COSTS OF $52 MILLION WERE INCLUDED IN RATE BASE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012.
AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES ALSO AGREED THAT HELCO WOULD WITHDRAW ITS 2013 TEST YEAR RATE CASE, AND DELAY FILING A NEW RATE CASE UNTIL A 2016 TEST YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, HECO WOULD DELAY THE FILING OF ITS SCHEDULED 2014 TEST YEAR RATE CASE TO NO EARLIER THAN JANUARY 2, 2014. FOR BOTH UTILITIES, THE EXISTING TERMS OF THE LAST APPROVED RATE CASES CONTINUE. THE AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES THAT, STARTING IN 2014, HECO WILL BE ALLOWED TO RECORD REVENUE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM (RAM) REVENUES STARTING JANUARY 1 OF EACH YEAR THROUGH 2016. THE CASH COLLECTION OF RAM REVENUES WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED, STARTING JUNE 1 OF EACH YEAR THROUGH MAY 31 OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE AGREEMENT WAS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF HAWAII (PUC). FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE AGREEMENT, SEE THE FORM 8-K FILED BY HEI AND HECO ON JANUARY 29, 2013, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.
ON MARCH 19, 2013, THE PUC ISSUED A DECISION AND ORDER APPROVING THE AGREEMENT, WITH THE FOLLOWING CLARIFICATIONS, NONE OF WHICH CHANGE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RECORDED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012: (1) THE PUC REITERATED ITS AUTHORITY TO EXAMINE AND ASCERTAIN WHAT POST GO-LIVE CIS COSTS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REVIEW IN FUTURE RATE CASES; (2) THE PUC DISCOURAGED REQUESTING SINGLE ISSUE COST DEFERRAL ACCOUNTING AND/OR COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS DURING THE PERIOD OF RATE CASE DEFERRAL BY HECO AND HELCO; (3) THE PUC APPROVED THE AGREED-UPON RECOVERY OF CIP CT-1 AND CIS PROJECT COSTS THROUGH THE RAM, AS SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT, HOWEVER NOT SETTING A PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE PROJECTS AND (4) THE PUC REAFFIRMED ITS RIGHT TO RULE ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE MECO 2012 TEST YEAR RATE CASE IN ITS ONGOING RATE CASE PROCEEDING.
IN APPROVING THE AGREEMENT, THE PUC FOUND THAT THERE IS VALUE IN THE FACT THE AGREEMENT TERMINATES FURTHER ACCRUAL OF CARRYING COSTS FOR THE CIP CT-1 AND CIS PROJECTS PENDING POTENTIALLY LONG REGULATORY AUDITS OF THESE PROJECTS. THE PUC EXPECTS THE AGREEMENT TO FREE UP RESOURCES OF THE COMPANIES TO ENABLE GREATER FOCUS ON ACHIEVING HAWAIIS STATUTORY ENERGY MANDATES AND POLICIES OF INCREASED ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE GENERATION AND IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES.

      ON MARCH 19, 2013, HEI ENTERED INTO (A) AN UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT (THE UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT) WITH J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND MORGAN STANLEY & CO. LLC (COLLECTIVELY, THE UNDERWRITERS) AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC ACTING AS AGENT (THE FORWARD SELLER) OF AN AFFILIATE OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, LONDON BRANCH (THE FORWARD PURCHASER), RELATING TO THE OFFER AND SALE TO THE UNDERWRITERS OF 6,100,000 SHARES OF HEIS COMMON STOCK, NO PAR VALUE (PLUS UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 900,000 SHARES PURSUANT TO AN OPTION GRANTED TO THE UNDERWRITERS TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES TO COVER OVER-ALLOTMENTS), BY THE COMPANY OR THE FORWARD SELLER, AND (B) A LETTER AGREEMENT DATED MARCH 19, 2013 (THE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT) BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE FORWARD PURCHASER RELATING TO THE FORWARD SALE BY THE COMPANY, SUBJECT TO HEIS RIGHT TO ELECT CASH SETTLEMENT OR NET SHARE SETTLEMENT (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT) OF A NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD TO THE UNDERWRITERS. 
      ON MARCH 20, 2013, THE UNDERWRITERS EXERCISED THEIR OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION IN FULL TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL 900,000 SHARES OF HEIS COMMON STOCK. IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH EXERCISE, HEI ENTERED INTO A LETTER AGREEMENT DATED MARCH 20, 2013 (THE ADDITIONAL FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT), ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AS THE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT, RELATING TO THE FORWARD SALE BY THE COMPANY, SUBJECT TO HEIS RIGHT TO ELECT CASH SETTLEMENT OR NET SHARE SETTLEMENT (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE ADDITIONAL FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT) OF A NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD TO THE UNDERWRITERS PURSUANT TO THE OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION.  
      THE UNDERWRITERS ARE OFFERING ALL OF THE SHARES OF HEIS COMMON STOCK SOLD TO THEM PURSUANT TO THE UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT TO THE PUBLIC AT AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE PER SHARE OF $26.75 (THE OFFERING). THE CLOSING OF THE OFFERING, TOGETHER WITH THE CLOSING OF THE SALE OF SHARES TO THE UNDERWRITERS PURSUANT TO THEIR OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION, OCCURRED ON MARCH 25, 2013. ALL 6,100,000 SHARES SOLD IN THE OFFERING, AND ALL 900,000 SHARES SOLD TO THE UNDERWRITERS UPON EXERCISE OF THEIR OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION, WERE BORROWED BY THE FORWARD SELLER AND SOLD TO THE UNDERWRITERS. HEI HAS NOT YET RECEIVED ANY PROCEEDS OF THE OFFERING, BUT WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT AND THE ADDITIONAL FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY, THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS) IN THE FUTURE WHEN HEI ISSUES SHARES TO THE FORWARD PURCHASER IN SETTLEMENT OF THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS (SUBJECT TO HEIS ABILITY TO CASH OR NET SHARE SETTLE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS).
      THE OFFERING HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, PURSUANT TO HEIS EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 (REGISTRATION NO. 333-177750). THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K SHALL BE DEEMED INCORPORATED INTO SUCH REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND THE FINAL PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT RELATING TO THE OFFERING.
      THE UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT IS FILED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 1.1. THE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT AND THE ADDITIONAL FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT ARE FILED HEREWITH AS EXHIBITS 10.1 AND 10.2, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE LEGALITY OPINION OF GOODSILL ANDERSON QUINN & STIFEL LLP RELATING TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IS FILED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 5.1.
UPON PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT OF THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS, HEI WILL ISSUE SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK TO THE FORWARD PURCHASER IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH PROCEEDS EQUAL TO THEN-APPLICABLE FORWARD SALE PRICE. THE INITIAL FORWARD SALE PRICE IS $25.74688 PER SHARE (WHICH IS THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE LESS THE UNDERWRITERS DISCOUNT) AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS. HEI WILL RECEIVE THESE PROCEEDS ONLY IF IT ELECTS TO PHYSICALLY SETTLE THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS.
      THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR SETTLEMENT ON ONE OR MORE SETTLEMENT DATES TO BE SPECIFIED BY HEI ON OR BEFORE MARCH 25, 2015. THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS PROVIDE THAT THE FORWARD SALE PRICE WILL BE ADJUSTED ON A DAILY BASIS BASED ON A FLOATING INTEREST RATE FACTOR EQUAL TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE LESS A SPREAD AND WILL BE DECREASED BY CERTAIN AMOUNTS ON SPECIFIED DATES SET FORTH IN THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS. 
 
1





 
THE INTEREST RATE FACTOR ADJUSTMENT WILL REDUCE THE FORWARD SALE PRICE ON EACH DAY ON WHICH THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE FOR THAT DAY IS LESS THAN THE SPREAD.
      EXCEPT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED BELOW, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, HEI HAS THE RIGHT TO ELECT PHYSICAL, CASH OR NET SHARE SETTLEMENT UNDER THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS. ALTHOUGH HEI CURRENTLY EXPECTS TO SETTLE THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS ENTIRELY BY PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT, HEI MAY ELECT CASH SETTLEMENT OR NET SHARE SETTLEMENT FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS IF IT DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN ITS INTERESTS TO DO SO. IF HEI ELECTS CASH OR NET SHARE SETTLEMENT, IF THE PRICE AT WHICH THE FORWARD PURCHASER OR ITS AFFILIATE PURCHASES SHARES OF HEIS COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET EXCEEDS THE APPLICABLE FORWARD SALE PRICE, THEN HEI WOULD HAVE TO:
·              IN THE CASE OF CASH SETTLEMENT, PAY TO THE FORWARD PURCHASER A CASH AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE; OR
·              IN THE CASE OF NET SHARE SETTLEMENT, DELIVER TO THE FORWARD PURCHASER A NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAVING A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE.
      CONVERSELY, IN CONNECTION WITH CASH OR NET SHARE SETTLEMENT, IF THE PRICE AT WHICH THE FORWARD PURCHASER OR ITS AFFILIATE PURCHASES SHARES OF HEIS COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET IS LESS THAN THE APPLICABLE FORWARD SALE PRICE, THEN THE FORWARD PURCHASER WOULD HAVE TO:
·              IN THE CASE OF CASH SETTLEMENT, PAY TO HEI A CASH AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE; OR
·              IN THE CASE OF NET SHARE SETTLEMENT, DELIVER TO HEI A NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAVING A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE.
      PURCHASES OF HEIS COMMON STOCK IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS BY THE FORWARD PURCHASER OR ITS AFFILIATE IN CONNECTION WITH CASH OR NET SHARE SETTLEMENT COULD INCREASE THE TRADING PRICE OF HEIS COMMON STOCK. THIS, IN TURN, COULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CASH, IN THE CASE OF CASH SETTLEMENT, OR THE NUMBER OF SHARES, IN THE CASE OF NET SHARE SETTLEMENT, HEI WOULD OWE, IF ANY, TO THE FORWARD PURCHASER UPON SETTLEMENT OF THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS.
      THE FORWARD PURCHASER MAY ACCELERATE SETTLEMENT OF THE FORWARD AGREEMENT AND REQUIRE HEI TO PHYSICALLY SETTLE THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS ON A DATE OF ITS CHOOSING IF:
·              IN ITS COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE JUDGMENT, IT OR ITS AFFILIATE EITHER:
·              IS UNABLE TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE UNDER THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT SHARES OF HEIS COMMON STOCK BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING BY LENDERS; OR
·              WOULD INCUR A COST TO BORROW SHARES OF HEIS COMMON STOCK TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE UNDER THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS THAT EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED THRESHOLD;
·              HEI DECLARES ANY DISTRIBUTION, ISSUE OR DIVIDEND TO EXISTING HOLDERS OF HEIS COMMON STOCK WITH A RECORD DATE OCCURRING DURING THE TERM OF THE FORWARD AGREEMENT OR THE ADDITIONAL FORWARD AGREEMENT AND PAYABLE IN EITHER:
·              CASH IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED AMOUNT (OTHER THAN EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS);
·              SECURITIES OF ANOTHER COMPANY ACQUIRED OR OWNED BY HEI AS A RESULT OF A SPIN-OFF OR OTHER SIMILAR TRANSACTION; OR
·              ANY OTHER TYPE OF SECURITIES (OTHER THAN HEIS COMMON STOCK), RIGHTS, WARRANTS OR OTHER ASSETS FOR PAYMENT AT LESS THAN THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE, AS DETERMINED BY THE CALCULATION AGENT UNDER THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS;
·              CERTAIN OWNERSHIP THRESHOLDS APPLICABLE TO THE FORWARD PURCHASER ARE EXCEEDED;
 
2





 
·              CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT OR TERMINATION EVENTS OCCUR, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ANY MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATION BY HEI UNDER THE FORWARD AGREEMENTS OR CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY EVENTS RELATING TO HEI; OR

NJNG SHUT OFF THE NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SERVES THE HURRICANE-DAMAGED BARRIER ISLANDS OF NEW JERSEY AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 30,000 OF NJNG'S 500,000 CUSTOMERS. ON NOVEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY GAVE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES ON THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF THE STORM ON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE COSTS (O&M) AND UTILITY GROSS MARGIN.   THE COMPANY NOW OFFERS THE FOLLOWING STORM-RELATED UPDATES AS OF JANUARY 9, 2013: •APPROXIMATELY 90 PERCENT OF THE CURTAILED CUSTOMERS NOW HAVE NATURAL GAS SERVICE AVAILABLE WITH ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS BEING ADDED DAILY.  LESS THAN 3,500 CUSTOMERS ARE NOW WITHOUT SERVICE. •TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO SUPERSTORM SANDY ARE NOW ESTIMATED AT $30 TO $40 MILLION, DOWN FROM THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF $40 TO $60 MILLION. NJNG EXPECTS TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $20 TO $27 MILLION OF THIS AMOUNT IN FISCAL 2013 WITH THE BALANCE INVESTED OVER THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE DECREASE IS LESS MAIN REPLACEMENT COMPARED WITH ORIGINAL ESTIMATES AND THE FAVORABLE COST OF EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENTS.  AS WITH NORMAL OPERATIONS, CAPITAL COSTS WILL BE TREATED AS ADDITIONS TO NJNG'S RATE BASE ON WHICH RECOVERY WILL BE SOUGHT IN A FUTURE BASE RATE CASE.   •TOTAL INCREMENTAL O&M COSTS ARE NOW ESTIMATED AT $15 TO $20 MILLION, COMPARED WITH THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF $12 TO $20 MILLION.  NJNG IS DEFERRING THESE COSTS FOR RECOVERY AT A LATER DATE, AND THEREFORE, SUCH COSTS SHOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON FISCAL 2013 EARNINGS. NJNG INTENDS TO SEEK RECOVERY OF THESE DEFERRED COSTS IN A FUTURE BASE RATE CASE.•NJNG HAS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET ITS CURRENT OBLIGATIONS AND TO FUND RESTORATION EFFORTS FROM A COMBINATION OF CASH ON HAND AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES. A $50 MILLION ACCORDION FEATURE IN NJNG'S SYNDICATED CREDIT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN EXERCISED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER NJNG'S REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. IN ADDITION, NJNG EXPECTS TO CLOSE ON THE ISSUANCE OF $50 MILLION OF NEW LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013. •THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS TO ISSUE EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2013 ON JANUARY 23, 2013.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS THIS FILING CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

IN AN OPINION HANDED DOWN ON JANUARY 25, 2013, THE KENTUCKY COURT OF APPEALS OVERTURNED A $28.45 MILLION JURY VERDICT RETURNED
AGAINST ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION AND TWO OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN SEPTEMBER 2009 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF EDMONSON COUNTY, KENTUCKY ARISING OUT OF THE PARK CITY GAS GATHERING PROJECT. THE DISPUTE WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE LITIGATION
INVOLVED THE AMOUNT OF ROYALTIES DUE FROM A THIRD PARTY PRODUCER TO LANDOWNERS FOR NATURAL GAS PRODUCED FROM THE LANDOWNERS PROPERTIES. THE THIRD PARTY PRODUCER WAS OPERATING PURSUANT TO LEASES BETWEEN THE LANDOWNERS AND CERTAIN
INVESTORS/WORKING INTEREST OWNERS.  IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION BY A THREE-JUDGE PANEL, THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE CLAIMS
ASSERTED AGAINST ATMOS ENERGY AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES BY THE LANDOWNERS AND THE INVESTORS/WORKING INTEREST OWNERS. THE COURT OF APPEALS CONCLUDED THAT ALL OF THE CLAIMS THAT ATMOS ENERGY AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES APPEALED SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISMISSED BY THE
TRIAL COURT AS A MATTER OF LAW. THE COURT OF APPEALS LET STAND THE JURY VERDICT ON ONE CLAIM THAT ATMOS ENERGY AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES CHOSE NOT TO APPEAL, WHICH WAS A TRESPASS CLAIM. THE JURY HAD AWARDED A TOTAL OF $10,000 IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO
ONE LANDOWNER ON THAT CLAIM. THE COURT OF APPEALS VACATED ALL OF THE OTHER DAMAGES AWARDED BY THE JURY AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE TRIAL COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL, SOLELY ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER PUNITIVE DAMAGES SHOULD BE AWARDED TO THAT LANDOWNER AND,
IF SO, IN WHAT AMOUNT. THE LANDOWNERS AND THE INVESTORS/WORKING INTEREST OWNERS MAY SEEK DISCRETIONARY REVIEW FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF KENTUCKY. THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS WILL NOT BECOME FINAL UNTIL THAT PROCESS IS COMPLETED.

IDAHO POWER COMPANY (""IDAHO POWER"") HAS POWER COST ADJUSTMENT (""PCA"") MECHANISMS IN ITS IDAHO AND OREGON JURISDICTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE VOLATILITY OF POWER SUPPLY COSTS AND PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RATES CHARGED TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS.  THE PCA TRACKS IDAHO POWER’S ACTUAL NET POWER SUPPLY COSTS (PRIMARILY FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER LESS OFF-SYSTEM SALES) AND COMPARES THESE AMOUNTS TO NET POWER SUPPLY COSTS CURRENTLY BEING RECOVERED IN RETAIL RATES.  IN THE IDAHO JURISDICTION, THE ANNUAL PCA ADJUSTMENTS ARE BASED ON (A) A FORECAST COMPONENT, BASED ON A FORECAST OF NET POWER SUPPLY COSTS IN THE COMING YEAR AS COMPARED TO NET POWER SUPPLY COSTS IN BASE RATES, AND (B) A TRUE-UP COMPONENT, BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS YEAR’S ACTUAL NET POWER SUPPLY COSTS AND THE PREVIOUS YEAR’S FORECAST.  THE LATTER COMPONENT ALSO INCLUDES A BALANCING MECHANISM SO THAT, OVER TIME, THE ACTUAL COLLECTION OR REFUND OF AUTHORIZED TRUE-UP DOLLARS MATCHES THE AMOUNTS AUTHORIZED.   ON APRIL 15, 2013, IDAHO POWER FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE IDAHO PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (""IPUC"") REQUESTING A $140.4 MILLION INCREASE IN IDAHO PCA RATES, EFFECTIVE FOR THE 2013-2014 PCA COLLECTION PERIOD FROM JUNE 1, 2013 TO MAY 31, 2014.  HOWEVER, TO LESSEN THE SINGLE-YEAR RATE IMPACT ON CUSTOMERS OF THE PCA RATE INCREASE, IDAHO POWER'S APPLICATION INCLUDED A PROPOSAL TO DEFER $52.5 MILLION OF THE PCA RATE INCREASE FOR INCLUSION IN THE JUNE 1, 2014 TO MAY 31, 2015 PCA COLLECTION PERIOD.  THE EXISTING PCA MECHANISM INCLUDES A ONE-PERCENT CARRYING CHARGE ON THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE, IF APPROVED, DEFERRED TO THE 2014-2015 PCA COLLECTION PERIOD.  WHILE THE PCA MECHANISM CONTEMPLATES THE ABILITY TO SPREAD THE RECOVERY OF A SINGLE YEAR'S PCA AMOUNT OVER MULTIPLE YEARS, THE IPUC HAS HISTORICALLY APPROVED RECOVERY OF PCA AMOUNTS IN MOST INSTANCES OVER A SINGLE PCA COLLECTION PERIOD.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, IDAHO POWER IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE IPUC'S DECISION ON ITS PCA APPLICATION, INCLUDING WHETHER IT WILL AUTHORIZE RECOVERY OF THE PCA AMOUNT OVER A SINGLE-YEAR OR MULTI-YEAR PERIOD.   DRIVERS OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PCA RATE INCREASE THAT IDAHO POWER REQUESTED IN ITS APPLICATION WERE ACTUAL HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION AND MARKET ENERGY PRICES FOR THE 2012-2013 PCA YEAR (APRIL 1, 2012 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2013) AT AMOUNTS LESS THAN FORECAST, DECREASED IMPACT OF REVENUE SHARING WITH CUSTOMERS DURING 2013 COMPARED TO 2012, FORECAST BELOW-AVERAGE HYDROELECTRIC GENERATING CONDITIONS DURING THE 2013-2014 PCA YEAR (APRIL 1, 2013 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2014), LOWER MARKET ENERGY PRICES FOR EXCESS POWER IDAHO POWER SELLS, AND THE EXPIRATION OF OTHER RATE CREDITS.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF POWER COST EXPENSES INCURRED UNDER THE PUBLIC UTILITY REGULATORY POLICY ACT OF 1978 AND CERTAIN DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAM COSTS THAT ARE FULLY PASSED THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS, THE PCA ALLOWS IDAHO POWER TO PASS THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS 95% OF THE DIFFERENCES IN ACTUAL NET POWER SUPPLY EXPENSES AS COMPARED TO BASE POWER SUPPLY EXPENSES, WHETHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE.  THUS, THE PRIMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT OF POWER SUPPLY COST DEFERRALS IS THAT CASH IS PAID OUT BUT RECOVERY OF THOSE COSTS FROM CUSTOMERS DOES NOT OCCUR UNTIL A FUTURE PERIOD, IMPACTING OPERATING CASH FLOWS FROM YEAR TO YEAR.  IF THE IPUC WERE TO ACCEPT IDAHO POWER'S PCA APPLICATION AS SUBMITTED, INCLUDING THE PROPOSED DEFERRAL OF A PORTION OF THE PCA INCREASE TO THE 2014-2015 PCA COLLECTION PERIOD, WHILE IT WOULD REDUCE NEAR-TERM CASH FLOWS, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT IDACORP, INC. AND IDAHO POWER DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT SUCH APPROVAL WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IDACORP, INC. AND IDAHO POWER EXPECT THAT THE ADVERSE NEAR-TERM CASH FLOW IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED DEFERRAL OF A PORTION OF THE PCA INCREASE TO THE 2014-2015 PCA COLLECTION PERIOD, IF ADOPTED BY THE IPUC, WOULD BE MITIGATED IN PART BY THE COMPANIES' CURRENT LIQUIDITY POSITION (INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM IDAHO POWER'S PREVIOUSLY REPORTED ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES IN APRIL 2013) AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL BONUS DEPRECIATION.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSTHIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K, AND IDAHO POWER COMPANY'S IDAHO PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FILING REFERRED TO IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K, CONTAIN (AND OTHER ASSOCIATED ORAL COMMUNICATIONS MADE BY IDACORP, INC.

THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE COMPANY'S PRESS RELEASE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP"").  A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP. MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE FOLLOWING IS AN UPDATE TO THE DISCLOSURES ON RATE REQUESTS AND DECOUPLING FILINGS IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSELECTRIC UTILITY UNDER MOST RECENT RATE PROCEEDINGS AND ANNUAL DECOUPLING FILINGS, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE TO PAGES 55-57 OF HEIS AND HECOS FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2013.
 
MECO 2012 TEST YEAR RATE CASE
 
ON MAY 31, 2013, THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF HAWAII (PUC) ISSUED A FINAL D&O IN THE MECO 2012 TEST YEAR PROCEEDING. THE FINAL D&O APPROVED AN INCREASE IN ANNUAL REVENUES OF $5.3 MILLION, WHICH IS $7.8 MILLION LESS THAN THE INTERIM INCREASE THAT HAD BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE JUNE 1, 2012 (INCLUDING THE $3.4 MILLION OF MECO REVENUE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM (RAM) REVENUES APPROVED IN THE ANNUAL DECOUPLING FILINGS SECTION BELOW, THE NET IMPACT TO ANNUAL REVENUES IS $4.4 MILLION LESS THAN THE INTERIM INCREASE). REDUCTIONS FROM THE INTERIM D&O RELATE PRIMARILY TO:
 



(IN MILLIONS) 

  

  

   


LOWER   RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY (ROACE)

$7.8 

    
 
ACCORDING TO THE PUC, THE REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWED ROACE FROM THE STIPULATED ROACE OF 10% TO THE FINAL APPROVED ROACE OF 9% IS COMPOSED OF 0.5% ALLOCATION TO LOWER INTEREST RATES AND 0.5% FOR OVER CURTAILMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY.
THE REDUCTION IN THE PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE IS DUE TO APPLYING A THREE-YEAR AVERAGE IN THE CALCULATION OF PENSION COSTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE 2012 TEST YEAR. THIS IS NOT A PUC DECISION TO CHANGE THE PENSION AND OPEB TRACKING MECHANISMS, ALTHOUGH THE PUC EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO EVALUATE ALTERNATIVES TO DECREASE OR LIMIT THE GROWTH IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS.
 
THE PUC ALSO CONTINUES MECOS EXISTING ENERGY COST ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE (ECAC) AND POWER PURCHASE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE (PPAC) DESIGN. THE PUC WILL CONSIDER HECO, HAWAII ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY (HELCO), AND MECOS (THE HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANIES) FUTURE ACTIONS TO REDUCE FUEL COSTS AND INCREASE USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AS IT CONTINUES TO REVIEW THIS MATTER IN THE FUTURE.
SINCE THE FINAL RATE INCREASE IS LOWER THAN THE INTERIM INCREASE CURRENTLY IN EFFECT, MECO WILL REFUND TO CUSTOMERS APPROXIMATELY $8.1 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST ACCRUED SINCE JUNE 1, 2012, THE DATE ON WHICH INTERIM RATE INCREASES WERE PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED. A SUMMARY OF THE INTERIM D&O IN EFFECT AND FINAL D&O IS AS FOLLOWS:

THE PUC ALSO DIRECTED THAT, WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE ISSUANCE DATE OF THE FINAL D&O, MECO FILE DOCUMENTATION REGARDING THE RE-SETTING OF ITS TARGET HEAT RATE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE OPERATION OF THE AUWAHI WIND FARM, AS WELL AS MAKE ITS CURTAILMENT INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ON ITS WEBSITE. THE PUC ALSO DIRECTED THAT, WITHIN 90 DAYS FROM THE ISSUANCE DATE OF THE FINAL D&O, MECO FILE A SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT AND CURTAILMENT REDUCTION PLAN.  MECO CONTINUES TO REVIEW THE D&O AND IS CONSIDERING WHAT FURTHER ACTION, IF ANY, IT MAY TAKE.
 
ANNUAL DECOUPLING FILINGS
 
ON MAY 31, 2013, THE PUC APPROVED THE REVISED ANNUAL DECOUPLING FILINGS FOR TARIFFED RATES FOR HECO, HELCO AND MECO THAT WILL BE EFFECTIVE FROM JUNE 1, 2013 THROUGH MAY 31, 2014. THE REVISED TARIFFED RATES INCLUDE: (1) THE INCREMENTAL RAM ADJUSTED REVENUES (THE COMPONENTS OF WHICH ARE SHOWN BELOW), (2) THE ACCRUED EARNINGS SHARING CREDITS TO BE REFUNDED, AND (3) THE AMOUNT OF THE ACCRUED REVENUE BALANCING ACCOUNT (RBA) BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 (AND ASSOCIATED REVENUE TAXES) TO BE COLLECTED. THE AMOUNTS APPROVED AS NOTED BELOW REFLECT THE HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANIES AGREEMENTS WITH THE POSITION OF THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE WHICH ARE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS FILED BY THE HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANIES IN MARCH 2013.

ALSO ON MAY 31, 2013, AS PROVIDED FOR IN ITS ORIGINAL ORDER ISSUED IN 2010 APPROVING DECOUPLING AND CITING THREE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE FOR HECO, THE PUC OPENED AN INVESTIGATIVE DOCKET TO REVIEW WHETHER THE DECOUPLING MECHANISM IS FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED. THE PUC AFFIRMED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THE SALES DECOUPLING (RBA) MECHANISM AND STATED ITS INTEREST IN EVALUATING THE RAM TO ENSURE IT PROVIDES THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF RISKS, COSTS, INCENTIVES AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND WHETHER THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE APPLIED TO THE OUTSTANDING RBA BALANCE IS REASONABLE.
THE HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANIES AND THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE ARE NAMED AS PARTIES TO THIS PROCEEDING AND ARE DIRECTED TO FILE A STATEMENT OF POSITION NO LATER THAN TWENTY DAYS FROM THE ORDER (I.E., BY JUNE 20, 2013).

THE FOLLOWING IS AN UPDATE TO THE DISCLOSURES ON THE MAUI ELECTRIC COMPANY, LIMITED (MECO) 2012 TEST YEAR RATE CASE, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE TO HEIS AND HECOS FORM 8-K FILED ON JUNE 4, 2013.
 
MECO 2012 TEST YEAR RATE CASE
 
ON MAY 31, 2013, THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF HAWAII (PUC) ISSUED A FINAL DECISION AND ORDER (D&O) IN THE MECO 2012 TEST YEAR PROCEEDING APPROVING AN INCREASE IN ANNUAL REVENUES OF $5.3 MILLION, WHICH IS $7.8 MILLION LESS THAN THE INTERIM INCREASE THAT HAD BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE JUNE 1, 2012 (INCLUDING THE $3.4 MILLION OF MECO REVENUE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM (RAM) REVENUES, THE NET IMPACT TO ANNUAL REVENUES IS $4.4 MILLION LESS THAN THE INTERIM INCREASE). THE MAJORITY OF THE REDUCTION IN ANNUAL REVENUES FROM THE INTERIM INCREASE RELATED TO A LOWERING OF MECOS ROACE FROM 10.0% TO 9.0%.
 
ON JUNE 12, 2013, MECO FILED A MOTION FOR PARTIAL RECONSIDERATION AND PARTIAL CLARIFICATION OF THE FINAL D&O, WHICH PRIMARILY REQUESTS RECONSIDERATION OF THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING MECOS 9.0% ROACE FOR THE TEST YEAR, BUT ALSO ADDRESSES OTHER MATTERS IDENTIFIED IN THE D&O. MECO IS REQUESTING A PANEL EVIDENTIARY HEARING ON ROACE, CURTAILMENT AND TECHNICAL STUDIES, AND PENSION EXPENSE.
 
MECO HAS ALSO REQUESTED TO PARTIALLY STAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL D&O, PENDING THE PRESENTATION AT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING ON ITS MOTION FOR PARTIAL RECONSIDERATION OF THE FINAL D&O RELATED TO THE ROACE REDUCTION FROM 10.0% TO 9.0% AND THE PUCS FINAL DECISION FOLLOWING THE HEARING.
 
UNTIL FURTHER DIRECTION IS OBTAINED FROM THE PUC, MECO PROPOSES TO IMPLEMENT IN THE MEANTIME, REVISED INTERIM RATES THAT WOULD INCLUDE ALL PORTIONS OF THE FINAL D&O OTHER THAN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A 9.0% ROACE. THIS WOULD REDUCE ANNUAL REVENUES BY $3.7 MILLION, INSTEAD OF THE $7.8 MILLION ORDERED BY THE D&O. MECO WOULD IMPLEMENT A REFUND PLAN BASED ON REFUNDING $3.7 MILLION ANNUALLY (PLUS INTEREST), BACK TO JUNE 1, 2012 WHEN THE INTERIM RATES WENT INTO EFFECT.
 
MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING, OR THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OR IMPACT, OF THE PUCS DECISION ON THE MOTION FOR PARTIAL RECONSIDERATION AND PARTIAL CLARIFICATION OF THE FINAL D&O AND REQUEST FOR A PARTIAL STAY OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL D&O.

IN THIS PRESS RELEASE, THE PER SHARE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE UTILITY GROUP, NONUTILITY GROUP EXCLUDING PROLIANCE RESULTS, AND CORPORATE AND OTHER ARE PRESENTED AND ARE NON-GAAP MEASURES.  SUCH PER SHARE AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON THE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION OF EACH GROUP INCLUDED IN VECTREN’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS DIVIDED BY VECTREN’S BASIC AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.  THE EARNINGS PER SHARE OF THE GROUPS DO NOT REPRESENT A DIRECT LEGAL INTEREST IN THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ALLOCATED TO THE GROUPS, BUT RATHER REPRESENT A DIRECT EQUITY INTEREST IN VECTREN CORPORATION'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS A WHOLE.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES.

THESE AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AT A STATUTORY TAX RATE DIVIDED BY VECTREN’S BASIC AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ANALYZING UNDERLYING AND ONGOING BUSINESS TRENDS IS AIDED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE PROLIANCE RESULTS AND THE RATIONALE FOR USING SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES IS THAT, THROUGH THE DISPOSITION BY PROLIANCE OF CERTAIN PROLIANCE ENERGY ASSETS, THE COMPANY HAS NOW EXITED THE GAS MARKETING BUSINESS.A MATERIAL LIMITATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THESE MEASURES IS THAT THE MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE PROLIANCE RESULTS DO NOT INCLUDE ALL COSTS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

MECO 2012 TEST YEAR RATE CASE
 
ON MAY 31, 2013, THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF HAWAII (PUC) ISSUED A FINAL DECISION AND ORDER (D&O) IN THE MAUI ELECTRIC COMPANY, LIMITED (MECO) 2012 TEST YEAR PROCEEDING WHICH RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN ANNUAL REVENUES FROM THE INTERIM INCREASE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A LOWERING OF MECOS RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY (ROACE) FROM 10.0% TO 9.0%.  SEE HEIS AND HECOS FORM 8-K FILED ON JUNE 4, 2013.
 
ON JUNE 12, 2013, MECO FILED A MOTION FOR PARTIAL RECONSIDERATION AND PARTIAL CLARIFICATION OF THE FINAL D&O, WHICH PRIMARILY REQUESTED RECONSIDERATION OF THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING MECOS 9.0% ROACE FOR THE TEST YEAR AND ALSO ADDRESSED OTHER MATTERS IDENTIFIED IN THE D&O, INCLUDING TREATMENT OF INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING (IRP) COSTS PENDING PUC DETERMINATIONS ON SUCH COSTS IN A SEPARATE IRP PROCEEDING. MECO REQUESTED A PANEL EVIDENTIARY HEARING ON ROACE, CURTAILMENT AND TECHNICAL STUDIES, AND PENSION EXPENSE.  MECO ALSO REQUESTED TO PARTIALLY STAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL D&O, PENDING THE PRESENTATION AT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING ON ITS MOTION FOR PARTIAL RECONSIDERATION OF THE FINAL D&O RELATED TO THE ROACE REDUCTION FROM 10.0% TO 9.0% AND THE PUCS FINAL DECISION FOLLOWING THE HEARING.

ON JULY 2, 2013, THE PUC ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING MECOS REQUESTS FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND FOR PARTIAL RECONSIDERATION, AND DISMISSED MECOS MOTION FOR PARTIAL STAY.  THE ORDER GRANTED MECOS MOTION FOR PARTIAL CLARIFICATION SUCH THAT MECO WILL BE ALLOWED TO DEFER IRP COSTS INCURRED SINCE JUNE 2012, WHICH TO DATE TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION, UNTIL THE LEVEL OF COSTS ARE DETERMINED AND A METHOD OF RECOVERY IS DECIDED IN THE IRP PROCEEDING.

THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE COMPANY'S PRESS RELEASE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP"").  A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP. MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH RELATIVE RETURN ON CAPITAL PERFORMANCE GOAL 
ON DECEMBER 19, 2013, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NATIONAL FUEL GAS COMPANY (THE COMPANY) MADE THE FOLLOWING
GRANTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH A PERFORMANCE GOAL RELATED TO RELATIVE RETURN ON CAPITAL (ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES) TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY: D. F. SMITH, 10,566; R. J. TANSKI, 11,372;
M. D. CABELL, 3,870; A. M. CELLINO, 2,844; AND D. P. BAUER, 1,264. THE GRANTS WERE MADE UNDER THE COMPANYS 2010 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN (THE 2010 PLAN). A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES IS PROVIDED BELOW.  THE NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED TO A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS REFERRED TO AS
THE OFFICERS ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY. THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE FOR THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES IS OCTOBER 1, 2013 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2016. EACH ROC PERFORMANCE SHARE WILL MAKE THE OFFICER ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE, NO LATER THAN
MARCH 15, 2017 BUT IN ANY EVENT AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, UP TO TWO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EQUIVALENT VALUE IN CASH, AS
DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE), PROVIDED THAT THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL NOT VEST AND WILL BE FORFEITED TO THE EXTENT THE PERFORMANCE GOAL IS NOT ACHIEVED. NO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES. 
THE PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR THE OCTOBER 1, 2013 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 PERFORMANCE CYCLE IS THE COMPANYS TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL RELATIVE TO THE
TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL OF OTHER COMPANIES IN A GROUP SELECTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE REPORT GROUP). THE REPORT GROUP CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING COMPANIES: 
AGL RESOURCES INC.  ATMOS ENERGY
CORPORATION  CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION 
ENERGEN CORPORATION  EQT
CORPORATION  MDU RESOURCES GROUP INC. 
NATIONAL FUEL GAS COMPANY  NEW
JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  NORTHWEST NATURAL GAS COMPANY 
QUESTAR CORPORATION  QUICKSILVER
RESOURCES INC.  RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION 
SM ENERGY COMPANY  SOUTHWEST GAS
CORPORATION  UGI CORPORATION 
ULTRA PETROLEUM CORPORATION 
WHITING PETROLEUM CORPORATION 


TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL FOR A GIVEN COMPANY MEANS THE AVERAGE OF THE COMPANYS RETURNS ON CAPITAL FOR EACH
TWELVE MONTH PERIOD CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS DURING THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE, BASED ON DATA REPORTED FOR THE COMPANY IN THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE. 
THE NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT WILL VEST AND BE PAID WILL DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE REPORT GROUP, AND NOT UPON THE
ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF RETURN ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED FIVE PERCENTILE RANKINGS THAT WILL DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID: (I) LESS THAN 45TH, (II) 45TH, (III) 60TH,
(IV) 75TH, AND (V) 100TH. THESE PERCENTILE RANKINGS WILL RESULT IN VESTING AND PAYMENT OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY,
AS FOLLOWS: (I) 0%, (II) 50%, (III) 100%, (IV) 150%, AND (V) 200%, RESPECTIVELY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE WERE TO PLACE IT AT THE 60TH PERCENTILE OF
THE REPORT GROUP, THEN 100% OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY WOULD VEST AND BE PAID. FOR PERFORMANCE BETWEEN TWO ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE LEVELS, THE PERCENTAGE OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID WILL BE DETERMINED BY MATHEMATICAL
INTERPOLATION. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE COMPANYS TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL IS NEGATIVE, THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY TO BE PAID WILL BE CAPPED AT 100%. ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT DO NOT VEST WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY
FORFEITED WHEN THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAKES ITS DETERMINATION AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, BUT NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2017. 
PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN PERFORMANCE GOAL 
ON DECEMBER 19, 2013, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY MADE THE FOLLOWING GRANTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH A PERFORMANCE GOAL RELATED TO TOTAL
SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES) TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY: D. F. SMITH, 10,566; R. J. TANSKI, 11,372; M. D. CABELL, 3,870; A. M. CELLINO, 2,844; AND D. P. BAUER, 1,264. THE
GRANTS WERE MADE UNDER THE 2010 PLAN. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES IS PROVIDED BELOW.  THE
NUMBER OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED TO A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS REFERRED TO AS THE OFFICERS TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY. THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE FOR THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES IS OCTOBER 1, 2013 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30,
2016. EACH TSR PERFORMANCE SHARE WILL MAKE THE OFFICER ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE, NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2017 BUT IN ANY EVENT AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN
ACHIEVED, UP TO TWO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EQUIVALENT VALUE IN CASH, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE), PROVIDED THAT THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL NOT VEST AND WILL BE FORFEITED TO THE EXTENT THE PERFORMANCE GOAL IS NOT
ACHIEVED. NO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES.  THE PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR THE OCTOBER 1, 2013 TO
SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 PERFORMANCE CYCLE IS THE COMPANYS THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN RELATIVE TO THE THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE OTHER COMPANIES IN THE REPORT GROUP. THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN FOR A GIVEN
COMPANY WILL BE BASED ON THE DATA REPORTED FOR THAT COMPANY (WITH THE STARTING AND ENDING STOCK 



PRICES OVER THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE CALCULATED AS THE AVERAGE CLOSING STOCK PRICE FOR THE PRIOR CALENDAR MONTH AND WITH DIVIDENDS REINVESTED IN THAT COMPANYS SECURITIES AT EACH EX-DIVIDEND
DATE) IN THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE.  THE NUMBER OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT WILL VEST AND BE PAID WILL DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE RELATIVE
TO THE REPORT GROUP, AND NOT UPON THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF RETURN ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED FIVE PERCENTILE RANKINGS THAT WILL DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID: (I) 30TH OR BELOW, (II) 40TH, (III) 50TH, (IV) 70TH, AND (V) 90TH OR ABOVE. THESE PERCENTILE RANKINGS WILL RESULT IN VESTING AND PAYMENT OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY, AS
FOLLOWS: (I) 0%, (II) 50%, (III) 100%, (IV) 150%, AND (V) 200%, RESPECTIVELY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE WERE TO PLACE IT AT THE 50TH PERCENTILE OF THE
REPORT GROUP, THEN 100% OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY WOULD VEST AND BE PAID. FOR PERFORMANCE BETWEEN TWO ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE LEVELS, THE PERCENTAGE OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID WILL BE DETERMINED BY MATHEMATICAL INTERPOLATION.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE COMPANYS THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN IS NEGATIVE, THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY TO BE PAID WILL BE CAPPED AT 100%. TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT DO NOT VEST WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY
FORFEITED WHEN THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAKES ITS DETERMINATION AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, BUT NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2017.

AN RSU IS A RIGHT TO RECEIVE ONE SHARE OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EQUIVALENT VALUE IN CASH OR IN A COMBINATION OF SHARES AND CASH, AS DETERMINED
BY THE COMMITTEE) AT THE END OF A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME (THE RESTRICTED PERIOD). EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN THE 2010 PLAN OR DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, THE RESTRICTED PERIOD WILL LAPSE, AND THE RSUS WILL VEST, IN
THREE ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS, COMMENCING ON DECEMBER 19, 2014. IF AN OFFICER RETIRES PRIOR TO A VESTING DATE, THE PORTION OF THE OFFICERS RSU GRANT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT VESTING DATE AND WITH ALL SUBSEQUENT VESTING DATES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY
FORFEITED. NO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF THE RSUS.  ANNUAL AT RISK COMPENSATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM

IN THIS PRESS RELEASE, THE PER SHARE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE UTILITY GROUP, NONUTILITY GROUP EXCLUDING PROLIANCE IN 2013, AND CORPORATE AND OTHER ARE PRESENTED AND ARE NON-GAAP MEASURES.  SUCH PER SHARE AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON THE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION OF EACH GROUP INCLUDED IN VECTREN’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS DIVIDED BY VECTREN’S BASIC AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.  THE EARNINGS PER SHARE OF THE GROUPS DO NOT REPRESENT A DIRECT LEGAL INTEREST IN THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ALLOCATED TO THE GROUPS, BUT RATHER REPRESENT A DIRECT EQUITY INTEREST IN VECTREN CORPORATION'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS A WHOLE.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES.  IN ADDITION, OTHER ITEMS GIVING RISE TO PERIOD OVER PERIOD VARIANCES, SUCH AS WEATHER, MAY BE PRESENTED ON AN AFTER TAX AND PER SHARE BASIS.  THESE AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AT A STATUTORY TAX RATE DIVIDED BY VECTREN’S BASIC AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.  ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE MEASURES ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING EACH BUSINESS’ CONTRIBUTION TO CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND IN ANALYZING CONSOLIDATED PERIOD TO PERIOD CHANGES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE CONTRIBUTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  RECONCILIATIONS OF THE NON-GAAP MEASURES TO THEIR MOST CLOSELY RELATED GAAP MEASURE OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE INCLUDED THROUGHOUT THIS PRESS RELEASE.  THE PRESS RELEASE ALSO CONTAINS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE THE RESULTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN PROLIANCE IN 2013.  MANAGEMENT USES CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME, CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS PER SHARE, AND NONUTILITY GROUP NET INCOME, EXCLUDING PROLIANCE RESULTS, TO EVALUATE ITS RESULTS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ANALYZING UNDERLYING AND ONGOING BUSINESS TRENDS IS AIDED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE PROLIANCE RESULTS AND THE RATIONALE FOR USING SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES IS THAT, THROUGH THE DISPOSITION BY PROLIANCE OF CERTAIN PROLIANCE ENERGY ASSETS, THE COMPANY HAS NOW EXITED THE GAS MARKETING BUSINESS.A MATERIAL LIMITATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THESE MEASURES IS THAT THE MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE PROLIANCE RESULTS DO NOT INCLUDE ALL COSTS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THIS LIMITATION BY PROMINENTLY DISPLAYING A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO THEIR CLOSEST GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES.

THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.

WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP.  MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DECEMBER 2011 SETTLEMENT STIPULATION PROVIDED AS FOLLOWS:•IF IDAHO POWER'S ACTUAL RETURN ON YEAR-END EQUITY IN THE IDAHO JURISDICTION (""IDAHO ROE"") FOR 2012, 2013, OR 2014 IS LESS THAN 9.5 PERCENT, THEN IDAHO POWER MAY AMORTIZE ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATED DEFERRED INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS (""ADITC"") TO HELP ACHIEVE A MINIMUM 9.5 PERCENT IDAHO ROE IN THE APPLICABLE YEAR.  IDAHO POWER WOULD BE PERMITTED TO AMORTIZE ADDITIONAL ADITC IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT UP TO $45 MILLION OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD. •IF IDAHO POWER'S ACTUAL IDAHO ROE FOR 2012, 2013, OR 2014 EXCEEDS 10.0 PERCENT, THE AMOUNT OF IDAHO POWER'S IDAHO-JURISDICTION EARNINGS EXCEEDING A 10.0 PERCENT IDAHO ROE AND UP TO AND INCLUDING A 10.5 PERCENT IDAHO ROE FOR THE APPLICABLE YEAR WOULD BE SHARED EQUALLY BETWEEN IDAHO POWER AND ITS IDAHO CUSTOMERS IN THE FORM OF A RATE REDUCTION TO BECOME EFFECTIVE AT THE TIME OF THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR'S POWER COST ADJUSTMENT UNDER THE IDAHO-JURISDICTION POWER COST ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM. •IF IDAHO POWER'S ACTUAL IDAHO ROE FOR 2012, 2013, OR 2014 EXCEEDS 10.5 PERCENT, THE AMOUNT OF IDAHO POWER'S IDAHO-JURISDICTION EARNINGS EXCEEDING A 10.5 PERCENT IDAHO ROE FOR THE APPLICABLE YEAR WOULD BE ALLOCATED 75 PERCENT TO IDAHO POWER'S IDAHO CUSTOMERS AS A REDUCTION TO THE PENSION REGULATORY ASSET AND 25 PERCENT TO IDAHO POWER.•THE IDAHO ROE THRESHOLDS (9.5 PERCENT, 10.0 PERCENT, AND 10.5 PERCENT) WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTED PROSPECTIVELY IN THE EVENT THE IPUC APPROVES A CHANGE TO IDAHO POWER'S AUTHORIZED RETURN ON EQUITY AS PART OF A GENERAL RATE CASE PROCEEDING SEEKING A RATE CHANGE EFFECTIVE PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2015.

ESG HAS ACQUIRED THE FEDERAL SECTOR ENERGY SERVICES UNIT OF CHEVRON ENERGY SOLUTIONS (CES), WHICH IS OWNED BY CHEVRON USA.  SEPARATELY, ESG WAS AWARDED A $45 MILLION CONTRACT FOR THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AT A WATER RECLAMATION FACILITY IN VIRGINIA. A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE DETAILING THE DEVELOPMENTS IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K.  FURTHER DETAILS OF THE ACQUISITION ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.THE BASE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE FEDERAL SECTOR ENERGY SERVICES UNIT OF CES WAS APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION, WITH ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TIED TO SPECIFIC CONTRACT TRANSFERS AND NEW ORDER TARGETS IN 2014 AND 2015. THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE COULD REACH $49 MILLION, IF $200 MILLION OR MORE OF NEW CONSTRUCTION/ENGINEERING CONTRACTS ARE SIGNED THROUGH 2015.FOLLOWING THE APRIL 1, 2014 CLOSE, FEDERAL SECTOR CUSTOMERS WILL BE ENGAGED IN A CONTRACT ASSIGNMENT PROCESS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2014.  HOWEVER, FROM CLOSING UNTIL THE FEDERAL CONTRACTS ARE ASSIGNED, ESG WILL BE PERFORMING ALL WORK THROUGH A MASTER SUBCONTRACT AGREEMENT WITH CES AND WILL RECEIVE ALL FINANCIAL BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACTS. THIS ACQUISITION IS PART OF ESG’S STRATEGY TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION AS A LEADER IN THE FEDERAL ENERGY SERVICES SECTOR.  BOTH ESG’S EXISTING FEDERAL TEAM AND THE BUSINESS UNIT BEING ACQUIRED HAVE ROBUST SALES FUNNELS THAT SHOULD RESULT IN STRONG PROJECT ORDERS IN 2014 AND 2015.  HOWEVER, THE FIRST YEAR’S CONTRIBUTION TO EARNINGS IS EXPECTED TO BE LIMITED DUE TO STARTUP COSTS AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO CONVERT AWARDED PROJECTS INTO CONTRACTED BACKLOG AND ULTIMATELY INTO REVENUE.  VECTREN’S 2014 EARNINGS GUIDANCE THAT WAS INITIATED IN FEBRUARY AND REFLECTED A MODEST LOSS FOR ITS ENERGY SERVICES SEGMENT, CONTEMPLATED THE IMPACTS OF THIS TRANSACTION.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE EXPECTED ADDITIONAL FEDERAL OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACQUISITION AND CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR EXISTING ENERGY SERVICES BUSINESS LINES, INCLUDING PERFORMANCE CONTRACTING, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT ENERGY SERVICES WILL RETURN TO PROFITABILITY IN 2015.PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT, THE ACQUISITION INCLUDES A PROVISION WHEREBY VECTREN ENTERPRISES, INC., ANOTHER WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY AND THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR THE COMPANY'S NONUTILITY INVESTMENTS, PROVIDES CES WITH AN INDEMNIFICATION FOR POTENTIAL CLAIMS AGAINST THE SELLER THAT COULD ARISE RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF WORK UNDERTAKEN BY ESG. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISION IS IN PLACE UNTIL WORK UNDER THE ESPC LICENSE EXPIRES, INCLUDING EXTENSIONS, WHICH COULD BE APPROXIMATELY 20-25 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.  THE ACQUISITION ALSO INCLUDES ESG GUARANTEES OF PERFORMANCE UNDER CERTAIN ASSUMED CONTRACTS.  THE GUARANTEES INCLUDE ENERGY SAVINGS THAT ARE USED TO SATISFY PROJECT FINANCING. THE TOTAL MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE ENERGY SAVINGS GUARANTEES IS APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION AND WILL ONLY BE CALLED UPON IN THE EVENT ENERGY SAVINGS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE EXISTING CONTRACTS EXECUTED BY CES ARE NOT ACHIEVED.  THE COMPANY IS GUARANTEEING ESG’S PERFORMANCE UNDER THESE ENERGY SAVINGS GUARANTEES. FURTHER, AN ENERGY FACILITY OPERATED BY ESG AND MANAGED BY KEENAN FT DETRICK ENERGY (KEENAN), IS GOVERNED BY AN OPERATIONS AGREEMENT.  ALL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO KEENAN UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE ALSO GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY. THE VECTREN ENTERPRISES, INC. PROVISION PROVIDING INDEMNIFICATION TO CES AND THE COMPANY GUARANTEE OF THE KEENAN FT DETRICK ENERGY OPERATIONS AGREEMENT WITH KEENAN AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DO NOT STATE A MAXIMUM GUARANTEE.  DUE TO THE NATURE OF WORK PERFORMED UNDER THESE CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY CAN ESTIMATE A MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS.  WHILE THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT NEITHER THE ENTERPRISES’ INDEMNIFICATION NOR THE COMPANY GUARANTEE PROVISIONS WILL BE CALLED UPON, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A MATERIAL AMOUNT BEING TRIGGERED UNDER ANY OF THESE PROVISIONS IS REMOTE.IN CONNECTION WITH THE ""SAFE HARBOR"" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, THE COMPANY IS HEREBY ATTACHING CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS IDENTIFYING IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED IN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MADE BY, OR ON BEHALF OF, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE COMPANY'S PRESS RELEASE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP"").  A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS.  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP.  MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDICATED IN ITS FILING THAT IT IS FOREGOING A RATE INCREASE REQUEST IN RECOGNITION THAT ITS CUSTOMERS ARE ALREADY IN A CHALLENGING HIGH ELECTRICITY BILL ENVIRONMENT. THE ABBREVIATED FILING INDICATED HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC IS AGGRESSIVELY ATTACKING THE ROOT CAUSES OF HIGH RATES, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, VIGOROUSLY PURSUING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SWITCH FROM OIL TO LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS, ACQUIRING LOWER-COST RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES, PURSUING OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, AND DEACTIVATING OLDER, HIGH-COST GENERATION. INSTEAD OF SEEKING A RATE INCREASE, HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AND EXECUTING THE NEW BUSINESS MODEL, PLANS AND STRATEGIES REQUIRED BY THE PUC’S APRIL 2014 REGULATORY ORDERS, AS WELL AS OTHER ACTIONS THAT WILL REDUCE RATES.IN ITS ABBREVIATED FILING, HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC SUBMITTED THE REQUIREMENTS IT BELIEVED WERE NECESSARY TO SATISFY ITS OBLIGATION TO FILE A GENERAL RATE CASE IN THE CYCLE ESTABLISHED BY THE PUC. IF THE PUC DETERMINES THAT ADDITIONAL MATERIALS ARE REQUIRED, HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC WOULD WORK WITH THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE ON A SCHEDULE TO SUBMIT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS NEEDED. THE ABBREVIATED FILING WAS SUBMITTED TO GET AN EXPEDITED DECISION THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN BASE RATES AT THIS TIME.IF HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC’S ABBREVIATED FILING IS ACCEPTED BY THE PUC, THE CURRENT RATE SCHEDULES AND RATE RECOVERY MECHANISMS WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL A DECISION IS MADE IN THE NEXT RATE CASE PROCEEDING. SUCH SCHEDULES AND MECHANISMS INCLUDE THE RATE SCHEDULES FOR THE VARIOUS RATE CLASSES, THE ENERGY COST ADJUSTMENT AND POWER PURCHASE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES IN THEIR CURRENT FORM, THE DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT SURCHARGE, THE PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT TRACKING MECHANISMS, AND THE DECOUPLING TARIFF. THE DECOUPLING REVENUE BALANCING ACCOUNT AND REVENUE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM WILL CONTINUE, SUBJECT TO ANY CHANGE TO THESE MECHANISMS ORDERED BY THE PUC IN SCHEDULE B OF THE DECOUPLING PROCEEDINGS. THE PANEL HEARINGS IN SCHEDULE B OF THE DECOUPLING PROCEEDING ARE SCHEDULED FOR LATE AUGUST 2014. HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC EXPECTS TO FILE ITS NEXT RATE CASE UNDER THE NORMAL RATE CASE CYCLE USING A 2017 TEST YEAR. IF CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, A RATE CASE MAY BE FILED EARLIER. MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THE PUC WILL ACCEPT THIS ABBREVIATED FILING TO SATISFY HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC’S OBLIGATION TO FILE A RATE CASE IN 2014, IF ADDITIONAL MATERIAL WILL BE REQUIRED, OR IF HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROCEED WITH A TRADITIONAL RATE PROCEEDING.HEI AND HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INTEND TO CONTINUE TO USE HEI’S WEBSITE, WWW.HEI.COM, AS A MEANS OF DISCLOSING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ON AUGUST 4, 2014 VECTREN CORPORATION (THE COMPANY) RELEASED FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY REGARDING THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014.  A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPORTING INFORMATION AND SCHEDULES ARE FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K. VECTREN CORPORATION IS THE PARENT COMPANY OF VECTREN UTILITY HOLDINGS, INC. (UTILITY HOLDINGS) AND VECTREN ENTERPRISES, INC. (ENTERPRISES).  UTILITY HOLDINGS IS THE INTERMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANY OF THE COMPANY’S THREE OPERATING PUBLIC UTILITIES, AND ENTERPRISES IS THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR THE COMPANY’S NONUTILITY OPERATIONS. IN THIS PRESS RELEASE, THE PER SHARE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE UTILITY GROUP, NONUTILITY GROUP EXCLUDING 2014 RESULTS RELATED TO COAL MINING AND 2013 RESULTS RELATED TO PROLIANCE, AND CORPORATE AND OTHER ARE PRESENTED AND ARE NON-GAAP MEASURES.  SUCH PER SHARE AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON THE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION OF EACH GROUP INCLUDED IN VECTREN’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS DIVIDED BY VECTREN’S BASIC AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.  THE EARNINGS PER SHARE OF THE GROUPS DO NOT REPRESENT A DIRECT LEGAL INTEREST IN THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ALLOCATED TO THE GROUPS, BUT RATHER REPRESENT A DIRECT EQUITY INTEREST IN VECTREN CORPORATION'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS A WHOLE.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES.  IN ADDITION, OTHER ITEMS GIVING RISE TO PERIOD OVER PERIOD VARIANCES, SUCH AS WEATHER, MAY BE PRESENTED ON AN AFTER TAX AND PER SHARE BASIS.  THESE AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AT A STATUTORY TAX RATE DIVIDED BY VECTREN’S BASIC AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.  ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE MEASURES ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING EACH BUSINESS’ CONTRIBUTION TO CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND IN ANALYZING CONSOLIDATED PERIOD TO PERIOD CHANGES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE CONTRIBUTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  RECONCILIATIONS OF THE NON-GAAP MEASURES TO THEIR MOST CLOSELY RELATED GAAP MEASURE OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE INCLUDED THROUGHOUT THIS PRESS RELEASE.  THE PRESS RELEASE ALSO CONTAINS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE THE 2014 RESULTS RELATED TO COAL MINING AND THE 2013 RESULTS RELATED TO PROLIANCE. MANAGEMENT USES CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME, CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS PER SHARE, AND NONUTILITY GROUP NET INCOME, EXCLUDING RESULTS FROM COAL MINING AND PROLIANCE IN THE RESPECTIVE YEAR OF DISPOSITION, TO EVALUATE ITS RESULTS. COAL MINING AND PROLIANCE RESULTS THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE GAAP MEASURES ARE INCLUSIVE OF HOLDING COMPANY COSTS (CORPORATE ALLOCATIONS, INTEREST AND TAXES) THAT WILL BE REALLOCATED AFTER THESE ASSETS ARE/WERE SOLD. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ANALYZING UNDERLYING AND ONGOING BUSINESS TRENDS IS AIDED BY THE REMOVAL OF COAL MINING AND PROLIANCE RESULTS IN THE RESPECTIVE YEAR OF DISPOSITION AND THE RATIONALE FOR USING SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES IS THAT, THROUGH PLANNED DISPOSITION OF THE COAL MINING SEGMENT AND THROUGH THE DISPOSITION BY PROLIANCE OF CERTAIN PROLIANCE ENERGY ASSETS, THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETELY EXITED THE NATURAL GAS MARKETING BUSINESS AND WILL EXIT THE COAL MINING BUSINESS WHEN THE TRANSACTION CLOSES.A MATERIAL LIMITATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THESE MEASURES IS THAT THE MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE COAL MINING AND PROLIANCE RESULTS DO NOT INCLUDE ALL COSTS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THIS LIMITATION BY PROMINENTLY DISPLAYING A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO THEIR CLOSEST GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES.

THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE COMPANY'S PRESS RELEASE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP"").  A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-RECURRING OR INFREQUENT ITEMS. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP. MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON ASSETS HELD IN TRUSTS FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

OLD MORTGAGE INDENTURE. THE 36TH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE AMENDS AND RESTATES THE OLD MORTGAGE INDENTURE IN ITS ENTIRETY AND NAMES U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS TRUSTEE (THE

ITEM).  THE AMENDED AND RESTATED INDENTURE OF MORTGAGE DATED AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2014 (NEW MORTGAGE INDENTURE), SECURES
ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS (FMBS) ISSUED UNDER THE OLD MORTGAGE INDENTURE. THE NEW MORTGAGE INDENTURE PROVIDES A DIRECT FIRST MORTGAGE LIEN UPON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE OPERATING PROPERTIES AND FRANCHISES OF NJNG (OTHER
THAN EXCEPTED PROPERTY, SUCH AS CASH ON HAND, CHOSES-IN-ACTION, SECURITIES, RENT, NATURAL GAS METERS AND CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUPPLIES, APPLIANCES AND VEHICLES), SUBJECT ONLY TO CERTAIN PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES. THE NEW MORTGAGE INDENTURE CONTAINS

REFUNDING REVENUE BONDS SERIES 2011A-C (NEW JERSEY NATURAL GAS COMPANY PROJECT) (EDA BONDS) ISSUED BY THE NEW JERSEY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (NJEDA). IN CONNECTION WITH THE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATE MODE, NJNG ENTERED

0.55% PLUS 70% OF ONE MONTH LIBOR, SUBJECT TO EARLIER REDEMPTION OR CONVERSION TO ANOTHER INTEREST RATE MODE. THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE ON THE EDA BONDS IS 12% PER ANNUM. NJNGS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT (AND ITS CORRESPONDING
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FMBS) MATCH THE RESPECTIVE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, INTEREST RATES AND MATURITY DATES OF THE EDA BONDS. THE EDA BONDS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO OPTIONAL TENDER WHILE THEY BEAR INTEREST AT A LIBOR INDEX RATE. 
THE CCA ALSO CONTAINS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND DEFAULTS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE CONTAINED IN SIMILAR FINANCING DOCUMENTS OF
NJNG, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (A) A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO (CONSOLIDATED TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS TO CONSOLIDATED TOTAL CAPITALIZATION AS DEFINED IN THE CCA), OF NOT MORE THAN 0.65 TO 1.00 AT ANY TIME; (B) LIMITATIONS ON LIENS AND
INCURRENCE OF DEBT, INVESTMENTS, AND MERGERS AND ASSET DISPOSITIONS, AND THE USE OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE CCA; (C) REQUIREMENTS TO PRESERVE CORPORATE EXISTENCE, AND COMPLY WITH LAWS; AND (D) DEFAULT PROVISIONS, INCLUDING DEFAULTS FOR
NON-PAYMENT, DEFAULTS FOR BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, DEFAULTS FOR INSOLVENCY, DEFAULTS FOR NON-PERFORMANCE OF COVENANTS, CROSS-DEFAULTS AND GUARANTOR DEFAULTS. 
AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE IN THE INTEREST RATE MODE ON THE EDA BONDS FROM A DAILY RATE, ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2014, NJNG TERMINATED THE
$100,000,000 FOUR-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., DATED AUGUST 29, 2011, WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY FOR ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT.

A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPORTING INFORMATION AND SCHEDULES ARE FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.3 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K. VECTREN CORPORATION IS THE PARENT COMPANY OF VECTREN UTILITY HOLDINGS, INC. (UTILITY HOLDINGS) AND VECTREN ENTERPRISES, INC. (ENTERPRISES).  UTILITY HOLDINGS IS THE INTERMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANY OF THE COMPANY’S THREE OPERATING PUBLIC UTILITIES, AND ENTERPRISES IS THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR THE COMPANY’S NONUTILITY OPERATIONS. IN THE PRESS RELEASE, THE PER SHARE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE UTILITY GROUP, NONUTILITY GROUP EXCLUDING 2014 RESULTS RELATED TO COAL MINING AND 2013 RESULTS RELATED TO PROLIANCE HOLDINGS, LLC (PROLIANCE OR PROLIANCE HOLDINGS), AND CORPORATE AND OTHER ARE PRESENTED AND ARE NON-GAAP MEASURES.  SUCH PER SHARE AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON THE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION OF EACH GROUP INCLUDED IN VECTREN’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS DIVIDED BY VECTREN’S BASIC AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.  THE EARNINGS PER SHARE OF THE GROUPS DO NOT REPRESENT A DIRECT LEGAL INTEREST IN THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ALLOCATED TO THE GROUPS, BUT RATHER REPRESENT A DIRECT EQUITY INTEREST IN VECTREN CORPORATION'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS A WHOLE.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES.  IN ADDITION, OTHER ITEMS GIVING RISE TO PERIOD OVER PERIOD VARIANCES, SUCH AS WEATHER, MAY BE PRESENTED ON AN AFTER TAX AND PER SHARE BASIS.  THESE AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AT A STATUTORY TAX RATE DIVIDED BY VECTREN’S BASIC AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.  ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE MEASURES ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING EACH BUSINESS’ CONTRIBUTION TO CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND IN ANALYZING CONSOLIDATED PERIOD TO PERIOD CHANGES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE CONTRIBUTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  RECONCILIATIONS OF THE NON-GAAP MEASURES TO THEIR MOST CLOSELY RELATED GAAP MEASURE OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE INCLUDED THROUGHOUT THIS PRESS RELEASE.  THE PRESS RELEASE ALSO CONTAINS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE THE 2014 RESULTS RELATED TO COAL MINING AND THE 2013 RESULTS RELATED TO PROLIANCE PRIOR TO ITS SALE OF CERTAIN OF THE NET ASSETS OF PROLIANCE ENERGY, LLC, ITS GAS MARKETING SUBSIDIARY, IN JUNE 2013.  MANAGEMENT USES CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME, CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS PER SHARE, AND NONUTILITY GROUP NET INCOME, EXCLUDING RESULTS FROM COAL MINING AND PROLIANCE IN THE RESPECTIVE YEAR OF DISPOSITION, TO EVALUATE ITS RESULTS. COAL MINING AND PROLIANCE RESULTS THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE GAAP MEASURES ARE INCLUSIVE OF HOLDING COMPANY COSTS (CORPORATE ALLOCATIONS, INTEREST AND TAXES) THAT WILL BE REALLOCATED AFTER THESE ASSETS ARE/WERE SOLD. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ANALYZING UNDERLYING AND ONGOING BUSINESS TRENDS IS AIDED BY THE REMOVAL OF COAL MINING AND PROLIANCE RESULTS IN THE RESPECTIVE YEAR OF DISPOSITION AND THE RATIONALE FOR USING SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES IS THAT, THROUGH THE DISPOSITION OF THE COAL MINING SEGMENT AND THE DISPOSITION BY PROLIANCE HOLDINGS OF CERTAIN PROLIANCE ENERGY ASSETS, THE COMPANY HAS NOW EXITED THE NATURAL GAS MARKETING BUSINESS AND THE COAL MINING BUSINESS.A MATERIAL LIMITATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THESE MEASURES IS THAT THE MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE COAL MINING AND PROLIANCE RESULTS DO NOT INCLUDE ALL COSTS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THIS LIMITATION BY PROMINENTLY DISPLAYING A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO THEIR CLOSEST GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES.

THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP.  MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

MAUI ELECTRIC INDICATED IN ITS FILING THAT IT IS FOREGOING A BASE RATE INCREASE REQUEST IN RECOGNITION THAT ITS CUSTOMERS ARE ALREADY IN A CHALLENGING HIGH ELECTRICITY BILL ENVIRONMENT. THE ABBREVIATED FILING INDICATED MAUI ELECTRIC CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ACTIONS TO INCREASE CUSTOMER OPTIONS AND REDUCE COSTS, SUCH AS TAKING STEPS TO (A) INTEGRATE MORE CUSTOMER-SITED DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES, LIKE ROOFTOP SOLAR, (B) ACQUIRE MORE LOWER-COST UTILITY-SCALE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES, (C) SWITCH FUEL FROM OIL TO LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS, (D) ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES IN EXISTING POWER PLANTS, AND (E) DEACTIVATE AND/OR DECOMMISSION OLDER, HIGH-COST POWER PLANTS.

IF THE PUC DETERMINES THAT ADDITIONAL MATERIALS ARE REQUIRED, MAUI ELECTRIC WOULD WORK WITH THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE ON A SCHEDULE TO SUBMIT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS NEEDED. THE ABBREVIATED FILING WAS SUBMITTED TO GET AN EXPEDITED DECISION THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN BASE RATES AT THIS TIME.IF MAUI ELECTRIC’S ABBREVIATED FILING IS ACCEPTED BY THE PUC, THE CURRENT RATE SCHEDULES AND RATE RECOVERY MECHANISMS WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL A DECISION IS MADE IN THE NEXT RATE CASE PROCEEDING OR AS NOTED LATER, SUBJECT TO THE OUTCOME OF SCHEDULE B OF THE DECOUPLING PROCEEDINGS. CURRENT SCHEDULES AND MECHANISMS INCLUDE THE RATE SCHEDULES FOR THE VARIOUS RATE CLASSES, THE ENERGY COST ADJUSTMENT AND POWER PURCHASE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES IN THEIR CURRENT FORM, THE DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT SURCHARGE, THE PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT TRACKING MECHANISMS, AND THE DECOUPLING TARIFF. THE DECOUPLING REVENUE BALANCING ACCOUNT AND REVENUE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM WILL CONTINUE, SUBJECT TO ANY CHANGE TO THESE MECHANISMS ORDERED BY THE PUC IN SCHEDULE B OF THE DECOUPLING PROCEEDINGS. MAUI ELECTRIC EXPECTS TO FILE ITS NEXT RATE CASE UNDER THE NORMAL RATE CASE CYCLE USING A 2018 TEST YEAR. IF CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, A RATE CASE MAY BE FILED EARLIER. MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THE PUC WILL ACCEPT THIS ABBREVIATED FILING TO SATISFY MAUI ELECTRIC’S OBLIGATION TO FILE A RATE CASE FOR 2015, IF ADDITIONAL MATERIAL WILL BE REQUIRED, OR IF MAUI ELECTRIC WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROCEED WITH A TRADITIONAL RATE PROCEEDING.HEI AND HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INTEND TO CONTINUE TO USE HEI’S WEBSITE, WWW.HEI.COM, AS A MEANS OF DISCLOSING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH RELATIVE RETURN ON CAPITAL PERFORMANCE GOAL 
ON DECEMBER 19, 2014, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NATIONAL FUEL GAS COMPANY (THE COMPANY) MADE THE FOLLOWING
GRANTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH A PERFORMANCE GOAL RELATED TO RELATIVE RETURN ON CAPITAL (ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES) TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY: R. J. TANSKI, 12,413; D. P. BAUER, 1,416;
M. D. CABELL, 5,058; A. M. CELLINO, 3,093; AND J. R. PUSTULKA, 3,042. THE GRANTS WERE MADE UNDER THE COMPANYS 2010 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN (THE 2010 PLAN). A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES IS PROVIDED BELOW.  THE NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED TO A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS REFERRED TO AS
THE OFFICERS ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY. THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE FOR THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES IS OCTOBER 1, 2014 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2017. EACH ROC PERFORMANCE SHARE WILL MAKE THE OFFICER ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE, NO LATER THAN
MARCH 15, 2018 BUT IN ANY EVENT AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, UP TO TWO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EQUIVALENT VALUE IN CASH, AS
DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE), PROVIDED THAT THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL NOT VEST AND WILL BE FORFEITED TO THE EXTENT THE PERFORMANCE GOAL IS NOT ACHIEVED. NO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES. 
THE PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR THE OCTOBER 1, 2014 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2017 PERFORMANCE CYCLE IS THE COMPANYS TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL RELATIVE TO THE
TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL OF OTHER COMPANIES IN A GROUP SELECTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE REPORT GROUP). THE REPORT GROUP CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING COMPANIES: 
AGL RESOURCES INC. 
ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION 
CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION 
ENERGEN CORPORATION 
EQT CORPORATION 
MDU RESOURCES GROUP INC. 
NATIONAL FUEL GAS COMPANY 
NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION 
NORTHWEST NATURAL GAS COMPANY 
QUESTAR CORPORATION 
RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION 
SM ENERGY COMPANY 
SOUTHWEST GAS CORPORATION 
UGI CORPORATION 
ULTRA PETROLEUM CORPORATION 
WHITING PETROLEUM CORPORATION 


TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL FOR A GIVEN COMPANY MEANS THE AVERAGE OF THE COMPANYS RETURNS ON CAPITAL FOR EACH
TWELVE MONTH PERIOD CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS DURING THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE, BASED ON DATA REPORTED FOR THE COMPANY IN THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE AT THE TIME OF ANALYSIS (OR, IF THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE CEASES TO BE
AVAILABLE, SUCH ALTERNATIVE PUBLICATION OR SERVICE AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE SHALL DESIGNATE).  THE NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT WILL VEST
AND BE PAID WILL DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE REPORT GROUP, AND NOT UPON THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF RETURN ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED FIVE PERCENTILE RANKINGS THAT WILL DETERMINE THE
NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID: (I) LESS THAN 45TH, (II) 45TH, (III) 60TH, (IV) 75TH, AND (V) 100TH. THESE PERCENTILE RANKINGS WILL RESULT IN VESTING AND
PAYMENT OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY, AS FOLLOWS: (I) 0%, (II) 50%, (III) 100%, (IV) 150%, AND (V) 200%, RESPECTIVELY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE WERE TO PLACE IT AT THE 60TH PERCENTILE OF THE REPORT GROUP, THEN 100% OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY WOULD VEST AND BE PAID. FOR PERFORMANCE BETWEEN TWO ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE LEVELS, THE PERCENTAGE OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES
TO VEST AND BE PAID WILL BE DETERMINED BY MATHEMATICAL INTERPOLATION. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE COMPANYS TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL IS NEGATIVE, THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY TO BE PAID WILL BE CAPPED AT 100%. ROC
PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT DO NOT VEST WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY FORFEITED WHEN THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAKES ITS DETERMINATION AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, BUT NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2018.

AFTER THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, UP TO TWO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EQUIVALENT VALUE IN CASH, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE), PROVIDED THAT THE TSR
PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL NOT VEST AND WILL BE FORFEITED TO THE EXTENT THE PERFORMANCE GOAL IS NOT ACHIEVED. NO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES.

RELATIVE TO THE THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE OTHER COMPANIES IN THE REPORT GROUP. THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN FOR A GIVEN COMPANY WILL BE BASED ON THE DATA REPORTED FOR THAT COMPANY (WITH THE STARTING AND ENDING STOCK PRICES
OVER THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE CALCULATED AS THE AVERAGE CLOSING STOCK PRICE FOR THE PRIOR CALENDAR MONTH 



AND WITH DIVIDENDS REINVESTED IN THAT COMPANYS SECURITIES AT EACH EX-DIVIDEND DATE) IN THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE AT THE TIME OF ANALYSIS (OR, IF THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE CEASES TO BE AVAILABLE,
SUCH ALTERNATIVE PUBLICATION OR SERVICE AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE SHALL DESIGNATE).  THE NUMBER OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT WILL VEST AND BE PAID
WILL DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE REPORT GROUP, AND NOT UPON THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF RETURN ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED FIVE PERCENTILE RANKINGS THAT WILL DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF TSR
PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID: (I) 30TH OR BELOW, (II) 40TH,
(III) 50TH, (IV) 70TH, AND (V) 90TH OR ABOVE. THESE PERCENTILE RANKINGS
WILL RESULT IN VESTING AND PAYMENT OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY, AS FOLLOWS: (I) 0%, (II) 50%, (III) 100%, (IV) 150%, AND (V) 200%, RESPECTIVELY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE WERE TO PLACE
IT AT THE 50TH PERCENTILE OF THE REPORT GROUP, THEN 100% OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY WOULD VEST AND BE PAID. FOR PERFORMANCE BETWEEN TWO ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE LEVELS, THE PERCENTAGE OF TSR
PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID WILL BE DETERMINED BY MATHEMATICAL INTERPOLATION. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE COMPANYS THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN IS NEGATIVE, THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY TO BE PAID
WILL BE CAPPED AT 100%. TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT DO NOT VEST WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY FORFEITED WHEN THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAKES ITS DETERMINATION AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, BUT NO LATER THAN

BUSINESS
 
NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION ASSETS
 
SINCE 2010, WE HAVE ACQUIRED GAS PRODUCTION AND GATHERING SYSTEM ASSETS AS A PART OF AN OVERALL STRATEGY TO PROVIDE RATE STABILITY AND CUSTOMER VALUE THROUGH THE ADDITION OF REGULATED ASSETS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO MARKET FORCES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THESE OWNED RESERVES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 76.7 BCF AND ARE ESTIMATED TO PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY 6.4 BCF EACH YEAR, OR ABOUT 32 PERCENT OF OUR CURRENT ANNUAL RETAIL NATURAL GAS LOAD IN MONTANA. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO SECURE LOW COST GAS RESERVES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS, WITH A TARGET OF OWNING 50% OF OUR SUPPLY.
 


WE ARE COLLECTING THE COST OF SERVICE FOR NATURAL GAS PRODUCED FROM PRODUCTION ASSETS ACQUIRED IN 2012 AND 2013 INCLUDING A RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, THROUGH OUR NATURAL GAS SUPPLY TRACKER ON AN INTERIM BASIS, AND HAVE RECOGNIZED APPROXIMATELY $22.8 MILLION OF REVENUE THAT IS SUBJECT TO REFUND. BASED ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR PENDING NATURAL GAS TRACKER FILING, OF THIS $22.8 MILLION IN PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED REVENUES, WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT WE MAY NEED TO REFUND UP TO $3.0 MILLION, WHICH WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUES DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014. WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS REVENUE REFUND OF UP TO $3.0 MILLION TO AFFECT OUR PREVIOUSLY ISSUED EARNINGS GUIDANCE.

 

FINANCING OF THE HYDRO TRANSACTION
 
THE FINANCING OF THE HYDRO TRANSACTION IS ANTICIPATED TO BE A COMBINATION OF UP TO $400 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, UP TO $450 MILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITY.
 
RISK FACTORS
 

RISKS RELATING TO THE NORTHWESTERN CORPORATION’S BUSINESS

 
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO LOWER HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION CAN INCREASE COSTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
WHEN WE CLOSE ON THE HYDRO TRANSACTION, WE WILL DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR POWER SUPPLY FROM HYDROELECTRIC FACILITIES. BECAUSE OF OUR HEAVY RELIANCE ON HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION, SNOWPACK, THE TIMING OF RUN-OFF, DROUGHT CONDITIONS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF WATER CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OPERATIONS. IF HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION IS LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED, WE MAY NEED TO INCREASE OUR USE OF PURCHASED POWER. WE EXPECT TO RECOVER PURCHASED POWER COSTS THROUGH OUR ELECTRIC TRACKER MECHANISM. RECOVERY OF INCREASED COSTS, HOWEVER, COULD BE SUBJECT TO RISK OF DISALLOWANCE WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR MAY NOT OCCUR UNTIL THE SUBSEQUENT POWER COST ADJUSTMENT YEAR, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY.
 
THE MPSC ORDER APPROVING THE HYDRO TRANSACTION PROVIDES THAT OUR CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE NO FINANCIAL RISK RELATED TO OUR TEMPORARY OWNERSHIP OF THE KERR PROJECT.
 
THE MPSC ORDER APPROVING THE HYDRO TRANSACTION PROVIDES THAT OUR CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE NO FINANCIAL RISK RELATED TO OUR TEMPORARY OWNERSHIP OF THE KERR PROJECT, WITH A COMPLIANCE FILING TO THAT EFFECT REQUIRED UPON
 



  


  





  



 
COMPLETION OF THE TRANSFER OF THE PROJECT TO CSKT. ACCORDINGLY, THE KERR PROJECT AND THE ASSOCIATED ASSETS WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN OUR REGULATORY RATE BASE. WHILE WE OWN THE KERR PROJECT, WE WILL OWN MORE GENERATION THAN OUR CUSTOMERS CAN USE. IF REVENUES FROM SALES TO THIRD PARTIES DURING THIS PERIOD ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER OPERATING COSTS AT THE KERR PROJECT, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PASS THOSE INCREMENTAL COSTS THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE BEAR THE RISK OF ANY DAMAGE TO THE KERR PROJECT THAT OCCURS DURING OUR TEMPORARY OWNERSHIP, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REMEDIATING ANY DAMAGE REPRESENT AN ADDITION OR IMPROVEMENT TO THE KERR PROJECT THAT MAY INCREASE THE CONVEYANCE PRICE PURSUANT TO THE KERR PROJECT LICENSE, AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH REPAIRS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY NOT BE FULLY COVERED BY ANY INSURANCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH COSTS ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE, THEY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
RISKS RELATING TO THE HYDRO TRANSACTION
 
THE HYDRO TRANSACTION MAY NOT BE CONSUMMATED ON THE TERMS EXPECTED OR AT ALL.
 
ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO CLOSE THE HYDRO TRANSACTION BY THE END OF DECEMBER 2014, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE HYDRO TRANSACTION WILL BE CONSUMMATED ON THE TERMS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT OR AT ALL, EVEN IF THIS OFFERING IS COMPLETED. CONSUMMATION OF THE HYDRO TRANSACTION CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO SATISFACTION OR WAIVER OF CLOSING CONDITIONS, IN PARTICULAR THE ISSUANCE OF FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE FERC ORDERS APPROVING THE TRANSFER OF HYDROELECTRIC LICENSES FOR THE PROJECTS TO BE ACQUIRED. WHILE FERC HAS ISSUED ORDERS APPROVING THE TRANSFER OF THE LICENSES, IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THE APPROVAL OF LICENSE TRANSFER WITH RESPECT TO THE KERR PROJECT HAS NOT YET BECOME FINAL AND NON-APPEALABLE. UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIED IN THE HYDRO TRANSACTION PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE OR PPL MONTANA MAY TERMINATE THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR THE NON-SATISFACTION OF CLOSING CONDITIONS.
 
IF THE HYDRO TRANSACTION IS NOT CONSUMMATED, WE WILL HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT COSTS WITHOUT COMMENSURATE BENEFIT, INCLUDING LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND OTHER COSTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, IF THE HYDRO TRANSACTION IS NOT CONSUMMATED BUT THIS OFFERING IS COMPLETED, THE PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY IN OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE WILL BE HIGHER THAN OUR TARGETED LEVEL, AND WE WILL NEED TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES TO ALIGN OUR DEBT AND EQUITY RATIOS WITH OUR TARGETED CAPITAL STRUCTURE. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE FERC AND MPSC APPROVAL OF OUR FINANCING FOR THE HYDRO TRANSACTION IS CONDITIONED ON THE PROCEEDS BEING USED TO CONSUMMATE THE HYDRO TRANSACTION, IF THE TRANSACTION IS NOT CONSUMMATED WE WOULD NEED EITHER TO (I) UNWIND THE FINANCING BY REDEEMING OUR ISSUANCE OF LONG TERM DEBT AND PURCHASING BACK AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF STOCK, OR (II) SEEK APPROVAL FROM FERC AND MPSC PRIOR TO USING THE FINANCING PROCEEDS FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN THE HYDRO TRANSACTION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FERC OR MPSC WOULD AUTHORIZE THE USE OF PROCEEDS FOR AN ALTERNATIVE PURPOSE.

THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE COMPANY'S PRESS RELEASE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP"").  A “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES (OR INCLUDES) AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS, ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING INCOME, OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (OR ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH GOALS, INCLUDING  THOSE USED FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, FOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES.  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES, THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AND CERTAIN NON-RECURRING, INFREQUENT, AND OTHER ITEMS.  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY REMOVING THE EFFECT OF VARIANCES IN GAAP REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH ITS PAST PRACTICE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN GENERAL, AND WILL ENABLE INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO COMPARE CURRENT NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH NON-GAAP MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO PRIOR PERIODS.    THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.THE COMPANY USES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PERIOD PRESENTED.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE IS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE, IT IS NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND FOR ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE TO REPRESENT AN EXPECTATION OF NET EARNINGS AS DEFINED BY GAAP.  SINCE THE FUTURE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GAAP AND ONGOING EARNINGS ARE FREQUENTLY OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN FORECASTED GAAP EARNINGS AND ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE, NOR THEIR PROBABLE IMPACT ON GAAP EARNINGS; THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A CORRESPONDING GAAP EQUIVALENT FOR FORECASTED ONGOING EARNINGS GUIDANCE.  RECONCILING ITEMS MAY INCLUDE REVENUES AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ECONOMIC HEDGES AND THE NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

(HAWAII ELECTRIC LIGHT) ON APRIL 9, 2012 AND BY MAUI ELECTRIC COMPANY, LIMITED. (MAUI ELECTRIC) ON MAY 4, 2012. DECOUPLING IS A REGULATORY MODEL THAT IS INTENDED TO FACILITATE MEETING THE STATE OF HAWAII’S GOALS TO TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY AND ACHIEVE AN AGGRESSIVE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. THE DECOUPLING MODEL IMPLEMENTED IN HAWAII DELINKS REVENUES FROM SALES AND INCLUDES ANNUAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS FOR CERTAIN OTHER OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) EXPENSES AND RATE BASE CHANGES. THE DECOUPLING MECHANISM HAS THREE COMPONENTS: (1) A SALES DECOUPLING COMPONENT VIA A REVENUE BALANCING ACCOUNT (RBA), (2) A REVENUE ESCALATION COMPONENT VIA A RATE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM (RAM) AND (3) AN EARNINGS SHARING MECHANISM, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE FOR A REDUCTION OF REVENUES BETWEEN RATE CASES IN THE EVENT THE UTILITY EXCEEDS THE RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY (ROACE) ALLOWED IN ITS MOST RECENT RATE CASE. DECOUPLING PROVIDES FOR MORE TIMELY COST RECOVERY AND EARNING ON INVESTMENTS IN BETWEEN RATE CASES. UNDER THE DECOUPLING TARIFF APPROVED IN 2011, THE ANNUAL RAM IS ACCRUED AND BILLED FROM JUNE 1 OF EACH YEAR THROUGH MAY 31 OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR.AS PART OF A JANUARY 2013 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE PUC, FOR RAM YEARS 2014 ­ 2016, HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC WAS ALLOWED TO RECORD RAM REVENUE BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1 AND TO BILL SUCH AMOUNTS FROM JUNE 1 OF THE APPLICABLE YEAR THROUGH MAY 31 OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR (CURRENT ACCRUAL METHOD). AFTER 2016, THE RAM PROVISIONS APPROVED IN 2011 WILL AGAIN APPLY TO HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2016, HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC FILED A MOTION REQUESTING THE CURRENT ACCRUAL METHOD FOR THE RAM THAT IS IN PLACE THROUGH THE END OF 2016, BE MADE PERMANENT. HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC’S REQUEST WAS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES SINCE THE PUC’S DECISION ON THE RAM REVENUES IN 2011, THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF DECOUPLING, AND CONSISTENCY WITH ACCRUAL ACCOUNTING. THE FILING ALSO REQUESTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC’S CURRENT ACCRUAL METHOD FOR RAM REVENUES FOR HAWAII ELECTRIC LIGHT AND MAUI ELECTRIC BEGINNING IN 2017. ON NOVEMBER 28, 2016, THE PUC ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC’S REQUEST TO MAKE THE CURRENT ACCRUAL METHOD PERMANENT, AND DENIED THE REQUEST TO IMPLEMENT THE CURRENT ACCRUAL METHOD FOR HAWAII ELECTRIC LIGHT AND MAUI ELECTRIC.  MANAGEMENT PRESENTLY BELIEVES THE IMPACT OF THE NOVEMBER 28 ORDER IS EQUIVALENT TO A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION IN PRO FORMA NET EARNINGS FOR HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC IN 2017, WHICH IN TURN EQUATES TO AN APPROXIMATELY 75 BASIS POINTS REDUCTION FROM HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC’S REALIZED 8% ROACE ACHIEVED OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS, ASSUMING ALL OTHER FACTORS ARE UNCHANGED.

PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH RELATIVE TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL PERFORMANCE GOAL 
ON DECEMBER 15, 2016, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NATIONAL FUEL GAS COMPANY (THE COMPANY) MADE THE FOLLOWING
GRANTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH A PERFORMANCE GOAL RELATED TO RELATIVE TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL (ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES) TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY: R. J. TANSKI, 28,854; D. P. BAUER, 4,232; AND J. R.
PUSTULKA, 11,361. THE GRANTS WERE MADE UNDER THE COMPANYS 2010 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN (THE 2010 PLAN). A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES IS PROVIDED BELOW. 
THE NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED TO A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS REFERRED TO AS THE OFFICERS ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY. THE
PERFORMANCE CYCLE FOR THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES IS OCTOBER 1, 2016 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. EACH ROC PERFORMANCE SHARE WILL MAKE THE OFFICER ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE, NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2020 BUT IN ANY EVENT AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE
AFTER THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, UP TO TWO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EQUIVALENT VALUE IN CASH, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE), PROVIDED THAT THE ROC
PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL NOT VEST AND WILL BE FORFEITED TO THE EXTENT THE PERFORMANCE GOAL IS NOT ACHIEVED. NO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF THE ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES. 
THE PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR THE OCTOBER 1, 2016 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PERFORMANCE CYCLE IS THE COMPANYS TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL RELATIVE TO THE
TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL OF OTHER COMPANIES IN A GROUP SELECTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE REPORT GROUP). THE REPORT GROUP CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING COMPANIES: 
ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION  CABOT
OIL & GAS CORPORATION  ENERGEN CORPORATION 
EQT CORPORATION  MDU RESOURCES
GROUP INC.  NATIONAL FUEL GAS COMPANY 
NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION 
RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION  SM
ENERGY COMPANY  SOUTHWEST GAS CORPORATION 
SOUTHWESTERN ENERGY CO.  SPIRE,
INC.  UGI CORPORATION  WGL
HOLDINGS INC.  WHITING PETROLEUM CORPORATION 


TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL FOR A GIVEN COMPANY MEANS THE AVERAGE OF THE COMPANYS RETURNS ON CAPITAL FOR EACH
TWELVE MONTH PERIOD CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS DURING THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE, BASED ON DATA REPORTED FOR THE COMPANY IN THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE AT THE TIME OF ANALYSIS (OR, IF THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE CEASES TO BE
AVAILABLE, SUCH ALTERNATIVE PUBLICATION OR SERVICE AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE SHALL DESIGNATE).  THE NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT WILL VEST
AND BE PAID WILL DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE REPORT GROUP, AND NOT UPON THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF RETURN ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED FIVE PERCENTILE RANKINGS THAT WILL DETERMINE THE
NUMBER OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID: (I) LESS THAN 45TH, (II) 45TH, (III) 60TH, (IV) 75TH, AND (V) 100TH. THESE PERCENTILE RANKINGS WILL RESULT IN VESTING AND PAYMENT OF A
PERCENTAGE OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY, AS FOLLOWS: (I) 0%, (II) 50%, (III) 100%, (IV) 150%, AND (V) 200%, RESPECTIVELY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE WERE TO PLACE IT AT THE 60TH PERCENTILE OF THE REPORT GROUP, THEN 100% OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY WOULD VEST AND BE PAID. FOR PERFORMANCE BETWEEN TWO ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE LEVELS, THE PERCENTAGE OF ROC PERFORMANCE SHARES
TO VEST AND BE PAID WILL BE DETERMINED BY MATHEMATICAL INTERPOLATION. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE COMPANYS TOTAL RETURN ON CAPITAL IS NEGATIVE, THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF THE ROC TARGET OPPORTUNITY TO BE PAID WILL BE CAPPED AT 100%. ROC
PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT DO NOT VEST WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY FORFEITED WHEN THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAKES ITS DETERMINATION AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, BUT NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2020. 
PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN PERFORMANCE GOAL 
ON DECEMBER 15, 2016, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY MADE THE FOLLOWING GRANTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES WITH A PERFORMANCE GOAL RELATED TO
RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES) TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY: R. J. TANSKI, 28,854; D. P. BAUER, 4,232; AND J. R. PUSTULKA, 11,361. THE GRANTS WERE MADE UNDER THE 2010 PLAN.
A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES IS PROVIDED BELOW.  THE NUMBER OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES
AWARDED TO A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS REFERRED TO AS THE OFFICERS TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY. THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE FOR THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES IS OCTOBER 1, 2016 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. EACH TSR PERFORMANCE SHARE
WILL MAKE THE OFFICER ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE, NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2020 BUT IN ANY EVENT AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, UP TO TWO SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EQUIVALENT VALUE IN CASH, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE), PROVIDED THAT THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL NOT VEST AND WILL BE FORFEITED TO THE EXTENT THE PERFORMANCE GOAL IS NOT ACHIEVED. NO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS WILL BE
PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF THE TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES.  THE PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR THE OCTOBER 1, 2016 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PERFORMANCE CYCLE IS THE
COMPANYS THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN RELATIVE TO THE THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE OTHER COMPANIES IN THE REPORT GROUP. THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN FOR A GIVEN COMPANY WILL BE BASED ON THE DATA REPORTED FOR THAT
COMPANY (WITH THE STARTING AND ENDING STOCK PRICES OVER THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE CALCULATED AS THE AVERAGE CLOSING STOCK PRICE FOR THE PRIOR CALENDAR MONTH AND WITH DIVIDENDS REINVESTED IN THAT COMPANYS SECURITIES AT EACH EX-DIVIDEND DATE) IN THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE AT THE TIME OF ANALYSIS (OR, IF THE BLOOMBERG DATABASE CEASES TO BE AVAILABLE, SUCH ALTERNATIVE PUBLICATION OR SERVICE AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE SHALL DESIGNATE). 


THE NUMBER OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT WILL VEST AND BE PAID WILL DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE
RELATIVE TO THE REPORT GROUP, AND NOT UPON THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF RETURN ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED FIVE PERCENTILE RANKINGS THAT WILL DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID:
(I) 30TH OR BELOW, (II) 40TH, (III) 50TH, (IV) 70TH, AND (V) 90TH OR ABOVE. THESE PERCENTILE RANKINGS WILL RESULT IN VESTING AND PAYMENT OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY, AS FOLLOWS:
(I) 0%, (II) 50%, (III) 100%, (IV) 150%, AND (V) 200%, RESPECTIVELY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE WERE TO PLACE IT AT THE 50TH PERCENTILE OF THE REPORT GROUP, THEN 100% OF
THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY WOULD VEST AND BE PAID. FOR PERFORMANCE BETWEEN TWO ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE LEVELS, THE PERCENTAGE OF TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES TO VEST AND BE PAID WILL BE DETERMINED BY MATHEMATICAL INTERPOLATION. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE,
IF THE COMPANYS THREE-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN IS NEGATIVE, THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TSR TARGET OPPORTUNITY TO BE PAID WILL BE CAPPED AT 100%. TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT DO NOT VEST WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY FORFEITED WHEN THE COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE MAKES ITS DETERMINATION AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, BUT NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2020.  RESTRICTED
STOCK UNITS  ON DECEMBER 15, 2016, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY MADE A GRANT OF 4,233 RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS)
TO D. P. BAUER, A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMPANY. THE GRANT WAS MADE UNDER THE 2010 PLAN. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE RSUS IS PROVIDED BELOW. 
AN RSU IS A RIGHT TO RECEIVE ONE SHARE OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EQUIVALENT VALUE IN CASH OR IN A COMBINATION OF SHARES AND CASH, AS DETERMINED
BY THE COMMITTEE) AT THE END OF A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME (THE RESTRICTED PERIOD). EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN THE 2010 PLAN OR DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, THE RESTRICTED PERIOD WILL LAPSE, AND THE RSUS WILL VEST, IN
THREE ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS, COMMENCING ON DECEMBER 15, 2017. IF AN OFFICER RETIRES PRIOR TO A VESTING DATE, THE PORTION OF THE OFFICERS RSU GRANT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT VESTING DATE AND WITH ALL SUBSEQUENT VESTING DATES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY
FORFEITED. NO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN RESPECT OF THE RSUS.  ANNUAL AT RISK COMPENSATION INCENTIVE PLAN 
ON DECEMBER 15, 2016, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ADOPTED SPECIFIC WRITTEN PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 UNDER THE 2012 ANNUAL AT RISK
