THE PRESS RELEASE PRESENTS EARNINGS AND EPS EXCLUDING (1) $8.8 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND $1.5 MILLION IN DEFERRED REVENUE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, (2) $11.3 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND $700,000 IN DEFERRED REVENUE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, (3) $9.7 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND $600,000 IN DEFERRED REVENUE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION AND (4) ACQUISITION-RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND LEGAL FEES) OF $6.8 MILLION DURING 2014. THE COMPANY HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED AN ACQUISITION OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROGRESSIVE TRANSACTION.•RETIREMENT CHARGES. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, RONALD W. ALLEN, FORMERLY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMPANY, RETIRED FROM THE COMPANY, EFFECTIVE AUGUST 31, 2014, AND ON JULY 24, 2014, DAVID L. BUCK, FORMERLY CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE COMPANY, NOTIFIED THE COMPANY THAT HE IS RETIRING AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND IN CONNECTION WITH HIS RETIREMENT RELINQUISHED HIS DUTIES AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1, 2014. THE COMPANY INCURRED $9.1 MILLION IN EXPENSES PERTAINING TO THE RETIREMENT OF THESE TWO OFFICERS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014. WHILE CHARGES RELATED TO RETIREMENT DO ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, MANAGEMENT REGARDS THE CHARGES INCURRED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014 AS UNCOMMON IN NATURE AND SIZE.•CALIFORNIA REGULATORY INVESTIGATION. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY RESOLVED THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED REGULATORY INVESTIGATION BY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL INTO THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS. THE PRESS RELEASE PRESENTS EARNINGS AND EPS EXCLUDING A $1.2 MILLION REDUCTION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014 OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED REGULATORY EXPENSE UPON SUCH RESOLUTION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND COSTS OF THIS PARTICULAR MATTER DIFFERENTIATED IT FROM THE COMPANY’S NORMAL COURSE LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.•STRATEGIC MATTERS. THE COMPANY AND ITS BOARD ADDRESSED VARIOUS STRATEGIC MATTERS DURING 2014, INCLUDING AN UNSOLICITED ACQUISITION OFFER, TWO PROXY CONTESTS AND SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS. THE COMPANY INCURRED $13.7 MILLION IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND LEGAL COSTS TO ADDRESS THEM DURING 2014. THESE MATTERS WERE UNPRECEDENTED IN THE COMPANY’S HISTORY, AND THE LEVEL OF THE PROFESSIONAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM WAS SIMILARLY EXCEPTIONAL.•RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED NEW STRATEGY, WHICH INCLUDES AN INITIATIVE TO RATIONALIZE THE COMPANY’S STORE BASE, THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $6.9 MILLION AND $2.3 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO STORE CLOSURES IN THE THIRD AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2014, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS ROUTINELY CLOSED AND SOLD STORES ON AN DISPOSED OF NON-CORE BUSINESSES IN SUBSTANTIALLY THEIR ENTIRETY, IT HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED A STORE RATIONALIZATION PROGRAM ACROSS THE COMPANY’S ENTIRE CORE BUSINESS, SO MANAGEMENT REGARDS THESE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AS UNUSUAL.2013 ADJUSTMENTS•CALIFORNIA REGULATORY INVESTIGATION. THE COMPANY ACCRUED $13.4 MILLION AND $15.0 MILLION FOR LOSS CONTINGENCIES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOW-RESOLVED INVESTIGATION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013 AND SECOND QUARTER OF 2013, RESPECTIVELY.•RETIREMENT AND VACATION RELATED CHARGES. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, WILLIAM K. BUTLER, JR., FORMERLY CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE COMPANY, RETIRED FROM THE COMPANY EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2013. THE COMPANY ALSO IMPLEMENTED CHANGES TO ITS VACATION POLICIES LAST YEAR. THE COMPANY RECORDED $4.9 MILLION IN CHARGES IN THE SECOND QUARTER RELATED TO THIS RETIREMENT AND CHANGE IN VACATION POLICIES. WHILE CHARGES RELATED TO RETIREMENT OR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ACTIONS OR POLICY CHANGES DO ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, MANAGEMENT REGARDS THE CHARGES INCURRED IN THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 AS UNCOMMON IN BOTH NATURE AND SIZE.WHILE SOME OF THE MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED AS NON-RECURRING IN NATURE IN A STRICTLY ACCOUNTING SENSE, MANAGEMENT REGARDS THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAGNITUDE OF THESE MATTERS AS NOT ARISING OUT OF THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND AS NOT ENTIRELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO PREDICTION OR MANAGEMENT CONTROL. FOR THESE REASONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT PRESENTATION OF NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EPS EXCLUDING THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS USEFUL BECAUSE IT GIVES INVESTORS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY’S UNDERLYING CORE BUSINESS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.ADJUSTED EBITDATHE PRESS RELEASE ALSO PRESENTS ADJUSTED EBITDA OF EACH OF THE COMPANY’S SEGMENTS.  ADJUSTED EBITDA EXCLUDES THE PROGRESSIVE-RELATED TRANSACTION COSTS, FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND LEGAL COSTS RELATED TO STRATEGIC MATTERS, RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT AND VACATION-RELATED CHARGES AND REVERSAL OF REGULATORY EXPENSE RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL INVESTIGATION DESCRIBED ABOVE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES PRESENTING THE COMPANY’S ADJUSTED EBITDA IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES SOME INDICATION OF WHAT THE RESULTS OF PROGRESSIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSENT THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANY’S ACQUISITION OF PROGRESSIVE, WHICH ARISE PRINCIPALLY FROM THE DEBT FINANCING OF THE TRANSACTION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED ACCOUNTING FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IT ALSO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON WHAT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSENT THE PROGRESSIVE ACQUISITION AND THE AFOREMENTIONED SPECIAL CHARGES.ITEM 9.01.

(1)ON FEBRUARY 26, 2015, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMPENSATION AND MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE (THE “COMPENSATION COMMITTEE”) OF PANERA BREAD COMPANY (THE “COMPANY”) APPROVED CHOICE AWARD AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD GRANTS (THE “AWARD GRANTS”) TO A NUMBER OF COMPANY EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING TWO OF THE COMPANY’S “NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS” (AS USED IN INSTRUCTION 4 TO ITEM 5.02 OF FORM 8-K):  RONALD M. SHAICH, THE COMPANY’S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND BLAINE E. HURST, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF TRANSFORMATION AND GROWTH OFFICER.  THE AWARD GRANTS WERE GRANTED IN LIEU OF GRANTING A THREE YEAR PERFORMANCE AWARD FOR THE 2015-2017 PERFORMANCE PERIOD (A “2015-17 PERFORMANCE AWARD”) UNDER THE COMPANY’S 2005 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM (“LTIP”), A SUB-PLAN UNDER THE COMPANY’S 2006 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE “2006 PLAN”).THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE APPROVED AWARD GRANTS BASED ON THE ELIGIBLE ASSOCIATES’ EXPECTED TARGET AWARD LEVEL FOR A 2015-17 PERFORMANCE AWARD (“AWARD VALUE”): $1,272,000 (150% OF CURRENT SALARY FOR MR. SHAICH) AND $348,125 (62.5% OF CURRENT SALARY FOR MR. HURST).  THE AWARD GRANTS WERE MADE UNDER THE 2006 PLAN AND CONSIST OF:•A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY’S CLASS A COMMON STOCK (“COMMON STOCK”) WITH A GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE EQUAL TO 50% OF THE APPLICABLE AWARD VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. •A CHOICE AWARD IN THE FORM OF A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD OR A STOCK SETTLED APPRECIATION RIGHT (“SSAR”).  SPECIFICALLY, EACH RECIPIENT MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE (1) UP TO THE SAME NUMBER OF RESTRICTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, OR (2) A SSAR TO PURCHASE A NUMBER OF SHARES EQUAL TO 3.5 TIMES THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WHICH THE RECIPIENT WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AS RESTRICTED STOCK AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, OR (3) A COMBINATION OF A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AND A SSAR (IN 25% INCREMENTS) DESCRIBED ABOVE.

FINALLY, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT THE AWARD GRANTS SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN THE COMPANY’S SENIOR MANAGEMENT RETENTION GOALS. (2)ADDITIONALLY, ON FEBRUARY 26, 2015, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE GRANTED TO MR. HURST A SPECIAL ONE-TIME RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD OF 3,095 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2006 PLAN.

MORETON, THE COMPANY’S EXECUTIVE VICE CHAIRMAN AND INTERIM CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER.  THIS PAYOUT REPRESENTS THE CASH AMOUNT THAT MR. MORETON WOULD HAVE RECEIVED UNDER THE LTIP FOR THE 2012 TO 2014 PERFORMANCE PERIOD HAD SUCH PERFORMANCE AWARD NOT BEEN FORFEITED IN CONNECTION WITH HIS TRANSITION TO EXECUTIVE VICE CHAIRMAN IN 2013.  SPECIFICALLY, THE BOARD APPROVED SUCH PAYOUT TO RECOGNIZE MR.

THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT ALSO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE VESTING OF OUTSTANDING AWARDS UNDER THE COMPANY’S EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS UPON CERTAIN TERMINATION EVENTS.

CAMPISI’S EMPLOYMENT TERMINATES AS A RESULT OF HIS RETIREMENT AFTER MAY 3, 2020, THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WOULD ENTITLE HIM TO: •A CASH PAYMENT EQUAL TO A PRORATED PORTION OF THE BONUS THAT HE WOULD HAVE EARNED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR IN WHICH THE TERMINATION OCCURRED HAD SUCH TERMINATION NOT OCCURRED; •CONTINUED VESTING FOR 24 MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF TERMINATION OF HIS UNVESTED, OUTSTANDING SERVICE-BASED EQUITY AWARDS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS GRANTED AFTER FEBRUARY 1, 2014 FOR WHICH THE PERFORMANCE CONDITION HAS BEEN SATISFIED (ANY SUCH AWARDS THAT VEST MORE THAN 24 MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF TERMINATION WILL BE FORFEITED); AND•A PRORATED PORTION OF HIS UNVESTED, OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE-BASED EQUITY AWARDS, TO BE DETERMINED BY MULTIPLYING (1) THE AMOUNT OF SUCH AWARD THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EARNED HAD HE REMAINED EMPLOYED THROUGH THE LAST VESTING DATE UNDER SUCH AWARD BY (2) A FRACTION, THE DENOMINATOR OF WHICH IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DAYS BETWEEN THE GRANT DATE OF THE AWARD AND THE LAST VESTING DATE UNDER SUCH AWARD AND THE NUMERATOR OF WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF DAYS BETWEEN THE GRANT DATE OF THE AWARD AND HIS TERMINATION DATE PLUS 730, PROVIDED THAT SUCH FRACTION WILL NOT EXCEED 1.00.  THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR THE ADDITION OF 730 TO THE NUMERATOR AS IT IS EQUIVALENT TO BOTH THE NUMBER OF DAYS (I) IN THE 24 MONTHS OF CONTINUED VESTING APPLICABLE TO HIS SERVICE-BASED EQUITY AWARDS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS AND (II) IN THE PERIOD HE WILL BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IMPOSED BY THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.  THIS PORTION OF MR. CAMPISI’S PERFORMANCE-BASED EQUITY AWARDS WOULD ONLY VEST, IT AT ALL, AFTER THE ACHIEVEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS AT THE END OF THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE PERIOD.  THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT ANY COMPENSATION PAID TO MR. CAMPISI PURSUANT TO THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT OR ARRANGEMENT WITH US) WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RECOVERY UNDER ANY LAW, GOVERNMENT REGULATION OR STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING REQUIREMENT WILL BE SUBJECT TO SUCH DEDUCTIONS AND CLAWBACK AS MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE MADE PURSUANT TO SUCH LAW, GOVERNMENT REGULATION OR STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING REQUIREMENT (OR ANY POLICY ADOPTED BY US PURSUANT TO ANY SUCH LAW, GOVERNMENT REGULATION OR STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING REQUIREMENT). THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE US TO REIMBURSE MR. CAMPISI FOR THE AMOUNT OF ANY EXCISE TAX IMPOSED UNDER SECTION 4999 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AS THE RESULT OF ANY PAYMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE “EXCESS PARACHUTE PAYMENTS” UNDER SECTION 280G OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.

CAMPISI UNDER THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, WHEN COMBINED WITH PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS UNDER ALL OTHER PLANS AND PROGRAMS MAINTAINED BY THE COMPANY, CONSTITUTE “EXCESS PARACHUTE PAYMENTS,” SUCH PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS WILL BE REDUCED TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO BECOME ONE DOLLAR LESS THAN THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD GENERATE AN EXCISE TAX LIABILITY UNLESS MR.

OTHER EVENTS.  SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES 
AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON FEBRUARY 4, 2015, OFFICE DEPOT, INC. (OFFICE DEPOT) ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
(THE MERGER AGREEMENT) WITH STAPLES, INC. (STAPLES) AND STAPLES AMS, INC., A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF STAPLES (MERGER SUB), PURSUANT TO WHICH, UPON THE TERMS AND SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, MERGER SUB WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO OFFICE DEPOT, WITH OFFICE DEPOT SURVIVING THE MERGER AS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF STAPLES. 
OFFICE DEPOT IS SUPPLEMENTING ITS DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE MERGER IN CONNECTION WITH LITIGATION BROUGHT BY STOCKHOLDERS OF OFFICE DEPOT.
NOTHING IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K SHALL BE DEEMED AN ADMISSION OF THE LEGAL NECESSITY OR MATERIALITY UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS OF ANY OF THE DISCLOSURES SET FORTH HEREIN, AND OFFICE DEPOT AND THE OTHER NAMED DEFENDANTS CONTINUE TO DENY ANY
WRONGDOING ALLEGED IN THE LITIGATION.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-4 OF STAPLES THAT WAS DECLARED
EFFECTIVE ON MAY 15, 2015, WHICH INCLUDES A PROSPECTUS OF STAPLES AND A PROXY STATEMENT OF OFFICE DEPOT, WHICH OFFICE DEPOT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON MAY 18, 2015 (THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS),
OFFICE DEPOT, ITS DIRECTORS, STAPLES, MERGER SUB, AND STARBOARD VALUE LP, AMONG OTHERS, ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY PURPORTED OFFICE DEPOT STOCKHOLDERS CHALLENGING THE MERGER, SEEKING, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, TO ENJOIN CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER. TO DATE, NINE LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (THE DELAWARE ACTIONS), AND TWO LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE FIFTEENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE
OF FLORIDA (THE FLORIDA ACTIONS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE DELAWARE ACTIONS, THE LAWSUITS).  OPERATIVE AMENDED
COMPLAINTS WERE DESIGNATED IN THE DELAWARE AND FLORIDA ACTIONS ON MARCH 31, 2015, AND APRIL 7, 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE LAWSUITS GENERALLY ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE DIRECTORS OF OFFICE DEPOT BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO
OFFICE DEPOT STOCKHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FAILING TO FULLY INFORM THEMSELVES OF THE MARKET VALUE OF OFFICE DEPOT, MAXIMIZE STOCKHOLDER VALUE, OBTAIN THE BEST FINANCIAL AND OTHER TERMS, DISCLOSE MATERIAL
INFORMATION IN THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND ACT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF PUBLIC STOCKHOLDERS, AND BY SEEKING TO BENEFIT THEMSELVES IMPROPERLY. THE LAWSUITS FURTHER ALLEGE THAT STAPLES, OFFICE DEPOT, AND STARBOARD VALUE LP, AMONG OTHERS, AIDED
AND ABETTED THE OFFICE DEPOT DIRECTORS IN THE BREACH OF THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES. THE LAWSUITS SEEK, IN GENERAL, (I) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ENJOINING, PRELIMINARILY AND PERMANENTLY, THE MERGER, (II) IN THE EVENT THAT THE MERGER IS CONSUMMATED,
RESCISSION OR AN AWARD OF RESCISSORY DAMAGES, (III) AN AWARD OF PLAINTIFFS COSTS, INCLUDING FEES, EXPENSES OF ATTORNEYS, FEES FOR EXPERTS, AND INTEREST, AND (IV) ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS IN THE PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, AMONG OTHER RELIEF. IN ADDITION TO THE ALLEGATIONS RAISED AND THE RELIEF SOUGHT IN THE DELAWARE ACTIONS, THE FLORIDA ACTIONS SEEK PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ALLEGE THAT THE FORUM SELECTION AMENDMENT TO OFFICE DEPOTS BYLAWS WAS
ADOPTED IN BREACH OF ALL DEFENDANTS FIDUCIARY DUTIES, AND SEEK A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT INVALIDATING IT.  ON MARCH 3, 2015, THE
PLAINTIFFS IN THE FLORIDA ACTIONS FILED MOTIONS TO CONSOLIDATE THE FLORIDA ACTIONS, APPOINT LEAD COUNSEL, AND FOR EXPEDITED PROCEEDINGS. ON MARCH 9, 2015, THE DEFENDANTS FILED MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINTS FOR IMPROPER VENUE, OR IN THE
ALTERNATIVE TO STAY THE FLORIDA ACTIONS IN FAVOR OF THE DELAWARE ACTIONS. ON MAY 15, 2015, THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER GRANTING THE DEFENDANTS MOTIONS TO DISMISS BASED ON OFFICE DEPOTS EXCLUSIVE FORUM BYLAW, DISMISSING THE FLORIDA
COMPLAINT WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO PLAINTIFFS REFILING THEIR CLAIMS IN DELAWARE, AND DENYING THE PLAINTIFFS MOTIONS FOR EXPEDITED PROCEEDINGS AS MOOT. 
ON MARCH 31, 2015, THE COURT CONSOLIDATED THE NINE DELAWARE ACTIONS UNDER THE CAPTION IN RE OFFICE DEPOT, INC. STOCKHOLDERS
LITIGATION, CONSOL. C.A. NO. 10655-CB. ON MAY 29, 2015, THE DELAWARE COURT SCHEDULED A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING ON PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO ENJOIN THE MERGER FOR JUNE 12, 2015. 
OFFICE DEPOT, STAPLES AND THE OFFICE DEPOT BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVE THAT THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THESE SUITS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTEND TO
DEFEND AGAINST THEM VIGOROUSLY, AND FURTHER BELIEVE THAT NO SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE IS REQUIRED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS. HOWEVER, OFFICE DEPOT WISHES TO MAKE CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES RELATED TO THE PROPOSED MERGER, AND ON JUNE 4, 2015, IN
CONNECTION WITH THE FILING OF THESE SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES, THE PLAINTIFFS WITHDREW THEIR MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.

CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED OR SHARES CURRENTLY HELD (OR SUBSEQUENTLY ACQUIRED) BY THE COMPANY AS TREASURY SHARES, INCLUDING SHARES PURCHASED IN THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS. 
THE 2015 PLAN WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OR SUCH OTHER COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF TWO OR MORE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE
COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS MAY BE APPOINTED BY THE BOARD TO ADMINISTER THE 2015 PLAN (THE COMMITTEE). THE COMMITTEE WILL DETERMINE THE INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM AWARDS WILL BE GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO AN AWARD, AND

UNDER WHICH OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS PURSUANT TO AWARDS GRANTED ON OR AFTER JUNE 19, 2015. THE
COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE BONUS PLAN ON APRIL 27, 2015, SUBJECT TO STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. THE RESULTS OF THE STOCKHOLDER VOTE ON THE BONUS PLAN ARE SET FORTH FURTHER BELOW UNDER ITEM 5.07 OF THIS CURRENT

THE BONUS PLAN PROVIDES THE COMPANYS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE COMPENSATION

(162(M) AWARD), AND (II) THOSE NOT INTENDED TO COMPLY WITH SUCH EXCEPTION (GENERAL AWARDS). TYPICALLY, GENERAL AWARDS WILL BE CONDITIONED ON PERFORMANCE, BUT THESE AWARDS MAY CONSIDER FACTORS (SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL
PERFORMANCE RATINGS) WHICH WOULD NOT QUALIFY AS PURE SECTION 162(M) PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY WILL PAY COMPENSATION EARNED UNDER THE BONUS PLAN IN CASH OR IN SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO A STOCKHOLDER-APPROVED
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN MAINTAINED BY THE COMPANY OR IN A COMBINATION THEREOF.  FOR A 162(M) AWARD, THE COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE WILL ESTABLISH AT LEAST ONE PERFORMANCE GOAL THAT IS INTENDED TO PERMIT THE AWARD TO COMPLY WITH THE SECTION 162(M) PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXCEPTION AND WILL DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM DOLLAR AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION PAYABLE UNDER
THE 162(M) AWARD FOR ATTAINMENT OF SUCH PERFORMANCE GOAL. HOWEVER, IN ALL CASES THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION THAT MAY BE PAYABLE TO AN INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT WITH RESPECT TO ONE OR MORE 162(M) AWARDS GRANTED IN ANY SINGLE
FISCAL YEAR OF THE COMPANY AND HAVING PERFORMANCE PERIOD(S) OF ONE FISCAL YEAR OR LESS WILL BE $5 MILLION; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IF ONE OR MORE 162(M) AWARDS GRANTED IN ANY SINGLE FISCAL YEAR OF THE COMPANY HAVE PERFORMANCE PERIOD(S) THAT SPAN
MORE THAN ONE FISCAL YEAR OF THE COMPANY, THEN THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION THAT MAY BE PAYABLE TO THE PARTICIPANT WITH RESPECT TO SUCH 162(M) AWARDS WILL BE $5 MILLION MULTIPLIED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WHOLE OR PARTIAL FISCAL
YEARS OF THE COMPANY SPANNED BY SUCH PERFORMANCE PERIODS.  THE AMOUNT PAYABLE UNDER A GENERAL AWARD MAY BE STATED AS A DOLLAR AMOUNT OR AS
A PERCENTAGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS BASE COMPENSATION. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (OR ITS DELEGATE) MAY PROVIDE FOR A THRESHOLD LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE BELOW WHICH NO BONUS WILL BE PAID AND A MAXIMUM LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE ABOVE WHICH NO ADDITIONAL
AMOUNT WILL BE PAID, AND IT MAY PROVIDE FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF COMPENSATION FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE.  THIS
SUMMARY OF THE BONUS PLAN IS SUBJECT TO AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE BONUS PLAN, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 10.4 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

ON MARCH 18, 2016, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF THOR INDUSTRIES, INC. (THE “COMPANY”) APPROVED AN AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE COMPANY’S BY-LAWS, EFFECTIVE
IMMEDIATELY.
 
IN ADDITION TO MINOR FORMATTING AND CONSISTENCY
CHANGES IMPLEMENTED BY THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE COMPANY’S BY-LAWS, A FORUM SELECTION PROVISION FOR THE ADJUDICATION
OF CERTAIN DISPUTES WAS ADDED AS SECTION 1 OF ARTICLE IX. THE PROVISION PROVIDES THAT UNLESS THE COMPANY CONSENTS IN WRITING TO
THE SELECTION OF AN ALTERNATIVE FORUM, THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (THE “COURT OF CHANCERY”) SHALL
BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR (I) ANY DERIVATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY, (II) ANY ACTION ASSERTING
A CLAIM OF BREACH OF A FIDUCIARY DUTY OWED BY ANY DIRECTOR, OFFICER, STOCKHOLDER, EMPLOYEE, OR AGENT OF THE COMPANY TO THE COMPANY
OR THE COMPANY’S STOCKHOLDERS, (III) ANY ACTION ASSERTING A CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR ANY DIRECTOR, OFFICER, STOCKHOLDER,
EMPLOYEE, OR AGENT OF THE COMPANY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY PROVISION OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF DELAWARE OR THE
COMPANY’S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OR BY-LAWS, OR (IV) ANY ACTION ASSERTING A CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR ANY DIRECTOR,
OFFICER, STOCKHOLDER, EMPLOYEE, OR AGENT OF THE COMPANY GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOCTRINE OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, THAT, IN THE EVENT THAT THE COURT OF CHANCERY LACKS SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION OVER ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING, THE
SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE ANOTHER STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
IN EACH SUCH CASE, UNLESS THE COURT OF CHANCERY (OR SUCH OTHER STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, AS
APPLICABLE) HAS DISMISSED A PRIOR ACTION BY THE SAME PLAINTIFF ASSERTING THE SAME CLAIMS BECAUSE SUCH COURT LACKED PERSONAL JURISDICTION
OVER AN INDISPENSABLE PARTY NAMED AS A DEFENDANT THEREIN.
 
THE PROVISION ALSO PROVIDES THAT (I) THE
FAILURE TO ENFORCE SUCH PROVISION WOULD CAUSE THE COMPANY IRREPARABLE HARM AND THE COMPANY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO EQUITABLE RELIEF,
INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, TO ENFORCE THE PROVISION, (II) ANY PERSON OR ENTITY PURCHASING OR OTHERWISE
ACQUIRING ANY INTEREST IN SHARES OF STOCK OF THE COMPANY SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE NOTICE OF AND CONSENTED TO THE PROVISION, AND
(III) IF ANY ACTION THE SUBJECT MATTER OF WHICH IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISION IS FILED IN A COURT OTHER THAN THE COURT OF
CHANCERY (OR ANY OTHER STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, AS APPLICABLE) (A “FOREIGN ACTION”)
BY OR IN THE NAME OF ANY STOCKHOLDER, SUCH STOCKHOLDER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE CONSENTED TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF THE COURT
OF CHANCERY (OR SUCH OTHER STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, AS APPLICABLE) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION
BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT TO ENFORCE THIS PROVISION AND HAVING SERVICE OF PROCESS MADE UPON SUCH STOCKHOLDER IN ANY SUCH ACTION
BY SERVICE UPON SUCH STOCKHOLDER’S COUNSEL IN THE FOREIGN ACTION AS AGENT FOR SUCH STOCKHOLDER. FINALLY, THE PROVISION PROVIDES
THAT THE EXISTENCE OF ANY PRIOR ALTERNATIVE FORUM CONSENT SHALL NOT ACT AS A WAIVER OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING CONSENT RIGHT
AS SET FORTH IN THIS PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO ANY CURRENT OR FUTURE ACTIONS OR CLAIMS.
 
SECTION 3 OF ARTICLE II WAS ALSO UPDATED
TO CONFORM TO A PREVIOUS CHANGE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION THAT ESTABLISHED
THE COMPANY’S CLASSIFIED BOARD STRUCTURE. THE UPDATED LANGUAGE IS AS FOLLOWS: “SECTION 3. ELECTION, CLASSES AND
TERM OF DIRECTORS. AS PROVIDED IN ARTICLE SEVENTH OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE CORPORATION, THE DIRECTORS SHALL
BE DIVIDED INTO THREE CLASSES AS NEARLY EQUAL IN NUMBER AS POSSIBLE. EACH CLASS OF DIRECTORS SHALL BE ELECTED FOR A TERM OF THREE

DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.THE COMPANY (“CHDN”) LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN (“COMPANY LTIP”) WAS CREATED IN 2008 TO PROVIDE CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD, FROM 2008 THROUGH 2012, FOR THE COMPANY ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS. UNDER THE COMPANY LTIP, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE “BOARD”), THROUGH ITS COMPENSATION SUBCOMMITTEE, ESTABLISHED CERTAIN PERFORMANCE TARGETS TIED TO COMPANY EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (“COMPANY EBITDA”).  OVER THE FIVE-YEAR TERM OF THE COMPANY LTIP, REPORTED COMPANY EBITDA GREW AT A 22.42% COMPOUNDED ANNUAL RATE FROM $55.1 MILLION IN 2007 TO $151.5 MILLION IN 2012.  DECEMBER 31, 2012, MARKED THE FINAL YEAR FOR THE COMPANY LTIP.  AS OF JANUARY 1, 2013, THE COMPANY, IN LIEU OF INITIATING A NEW PLAN, OPTED TO DEVELOP A NEW LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM UTILIZING THE 2007 OMNIBUS STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN. AS A WAY TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION, AN ENTREPRENEURIAL APPROACH, AND CAREFUL RISK ASSESSMENT, IN ADDITION TO THE RETENTION OF KEY EXECUTIVES, THE BOARD'S NEW INCENTIVE PROGRAM OFFERS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION TO THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS REPORTED IN THE COMPANY'S SCHEDULE 14A PROXY STATEMENT FILING, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ROBERT L. EVANS (INDIVIDUALS REFERRED TO AS “GRANTEE” AND COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE “GRANTEES”). RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS WERE ISSUED, TO THE GRANTEES, ON MARCH 21, 2013 UNDER THE NEW INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN TIME-VESTING AND STOCK PRICE-VESTING RESTRICTED STOCK. THE COMPENSATION WINDOW, FOR THE VESTING OF THE TIME-VESTING RESTRICTED SHARES IS FOUR (4) YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND THE STOCK-PRICE VESTING RESTRICTED SHARES, IS FIVE (5) YEARS, BEGINNING MARCH 21, 2013 AND CONTINUING FOR FIVE (5) YEARS FROM SUCH DATE (THE “COMPENSATION CYCLE”). FOR EACH GRANTEE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ALAN K. TSE, VESTING OF THE TIME-BASED RESTRICTED SHARES IS BACK-LOADED TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH YEARS (2015 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY). IN THE CASE OF MR. TSE, HIS TIME-BASED RESTRICTED SHARES VEST IN INCREMENTS OF TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT (25%) IN 2013, 2014, 2015, AND 2016. THE VESTING SCHEDULES FOR THE STOCK-PRICE BASED RESTRICTED SHARE AWARDS ARE TIED TO STOCK-PRICE TRIGGERS. THE STOCK-PRICE TRIGGERS, FOR THE GRANTEES, ARE COMPRISED OF FOUR (4) TRIGGERS TIED TO THE DAILY CLOSING NASDAQ STOCK MARKET PRICE FOR CHDN (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE “STOCK PRICE TRIGGERS”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

ON FEBRUARY 7, 2013,
AARON’S, INC. (THE “COMPANY”) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE TO ANNOUNCE ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER
AND FULL YEAR OF 2012. A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1.
 
THE PRESS RELEASE PRESENTS
THE COMPANY’S NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING: A $36.5 MILLION CHARGE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER
OF 2011 RELATED TO A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED LAWSUIT VERDICT AGAINST THE COMPANY, AND ASSOCIATED LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES, AND THE
SUBSEQUENT REVERSAL INTO INCOME OF $35.5 MILLION OF SUCH CHARGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THAT
LAWSUIT; A $10.4 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012 FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED RETIREMENT
OF THE COMPANY’S FOUNDER AND FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD; AND A $3.5 MILLION SEPARATION CHARGE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF
2011 RELATED TO THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DEPARTURE OF THE COMPANY’S FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THESE MEASURES ARE NOT
PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”).
 
WHILE THE LAWSUIT MAY
NOT BE CONSIDERED AS NON-RECURRING IN NATURE IN A STRICTLY ACCOUNTING SENSE, MANAGEMENT REGARDS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS PARTICULAR
LAWSUIT AS INFREQUENT AND NOT ARISING OUT OF THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. SIMILARLY, WHILE SEPARATION OR RETIREMENT CHARGES
DO ARISE, MANAGEMENT REGARDS THE SIZE OF THE RETIREMENT AND SEPARATION-RELATED CHARGES FOR THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS WHO DEPARTED
– ONE, THE COMPANY’S FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AT RETIREMENT, AND THE OTHER, ITS FORMER PRESIDENT AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER – AS UNCOMMON. THE ADJUSTMENTS INVOLVE MATTERS THAT ARE NOT ENTIRELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO PREDICTION OR EFFECTIVE
MANAGEMENT, AND CONSEQUENTLY MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT PRESENTATION OF NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING THESE
ADJUSTMENTS IS USEFUL BECAUSE IT GIVES INVESTORS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY’S
UNDERLYING CORE BUSINESS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, HOWEVER, SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR
CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, SUCH AS THE COMPANY’S GAAP BASIS
NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, WHICH ARE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE.

(“WE,” “US” OR “OUR”) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE AND CONDUCTED A CONFERENCE CALL, BOTH OF WHICH REPORTED OUR FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL FISCAL 2012 UNAUDITED RESULTS AND PROVIDED INITIAL GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2013.THE PRESS RELEASE AND CONFERENCE CALL BOTH INCLUDED “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,” AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED BY RULE 101 OF REGULATION G (17 CFR PART 244) AND ITEM 10 OF REGULATION S-K (17 CFR PART 229).  SPECIFICALLY, SEGMENT-LEVEL DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WAS INCLUDED.  THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE REFLECTS THE PORTION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OF OUR U.S. AND CANADIAN SEGMENTS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES WERE INCLUDED:  (I) ADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN; (II) ADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN RATE; (III) ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT; (IV) ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT RATE; (V) ADJUSTED INCOME TAX EXPENSE; (VI) ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE; (VII) ADJUSTED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS; (VIII) ADJUSTED NET INCOME; (IX) ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS; AND (X) ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES EXCLUDE FROM THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), A NON-CASH, AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $3.4 MILLION, OR $0.06 PER DILUTED SHARE, INCURRED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012 IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVENTORY ACCOUNTING CHANGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW RETAIL INVENTORY SYSTEMS ($5.6 MILLION ON A PRETAX BASIS).  AS REQUIRED BY RULE 100 OF REGULATION G AND ITEM 10 OF REGULATION S-K, THE PRESS RELEASE, WHICH WAS POSTED IN THE INVESTOR RELATIONS SECTION OF OUR WEBSITE AND REFERRED TO DURING THE CONFERENCE CALL, CONTAINED A PRESENTATION OF THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND A RECONCILIATION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT DISCLOSURE OF THE SEGMENT-LEVEL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY SEPARATELY REFLECT THE PORTION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OF OUR U.S. AND CANADIAN SEGMENTS.  OUR MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT DISCLOSURE OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE THE INVENTORY CHARGE PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE AND MORE RELEVANT METHOD FOR MEASURING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, EXCLUDING A SPECIAL ITEM INCLUDED IN THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, THAT OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS MORE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, ALONG WITH THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, ARE USED BY OUR MANAGEMENT IN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION FROM, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.01 PER SHARE (THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK AND, TOGETHER WITH THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, THE PREFERRED STOCK), TOGETHER WITH ANY OTHER VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY ACQUIRED
BY BC PARTNERS AFTER FEBRUARY 20, 2013, IN FAVOR OF THE ISSUANCE OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER ACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND AGAINST ANY ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION PROPOSAL WITH RESPECT
TO THE COMPANY. THESE OBLIGATIONS WILL BE SUSPENDED IF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS EFFECTS A CHANGE OF RECOMMENDATION WITH RESPECT TO THE MERGER, INCLUDING BY WITHDRAWING ITS RECOMMENDATION TO THE COMPANYS STOCKHOLDERS TO APPROVE THE
ISSUANCE OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, APPROVING OR RECOMMENDING, OR PUBLICLY PROPOSING TO APPROVE, AN ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION PROPOSAL WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY OR FAILING TO RECOMMEND AGAINST THE ACCEPTANCE OF A
TENDER OR EXCHANGE OFFER FOR ANY OF THE COMPANYS CAPITAL STOCK BY THE COMPANYS STOCKHOLDERS. AS OF FEBRUARY 20, 2013, BC PARTNERS HELD 274,596 SHARES OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND 75,404 SHARES OF THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK,
REPRESENTING TOGETHER, ON AN AS-CONVERTED BASIS, APPROXIMATELY 22% OF THE VOTING POWER OF THE COMPANY.  UNDER THE VOTING
AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES ALSO AGREED THAT, EFFECTIVE AS OF IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF (I) THE REQUISITE COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER AND (II) THE CONSENT OF THE LENDERS UNDER THE COMPANYS AMENDED
AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED MAY 25, 2011 (THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT), 50 PER CENT OF THE PREFERRED STOCK THEN HELD BY BC PARTNERS WILL BE REDEEMED FOR CASH BY THE COMPANY AT THE REDEMPTION PRICE APPLICABLE TO
THE PREFERRED STOCK. IN ADDITION, UPON SATISFACTION OR WAIVER OF THE CLOSING CONDITIONS UNDER THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND FOLLOWING RECEIPT BY THE COMPANY OF THE CONSENT OF THE LENDERS UNDER THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT, ALL REMAINING SHARES OF THE
PREFERRED STOCK THEN HELD BY BC PARTNERS WILL, EFFECTIVE AS OF IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER, BE REDEEMED FOR CASH BY THE COMPANY AT THE REDEMPTION PRICE APPLICABLE TO THE PREFERRED STOCK. 
AT ANY TIME FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF THE REQUISITE COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER AND PRIOR TO SUCH REDEMPTION,
BC PARTNERS MAY NOT CONVERT THEIR PREFERRED STOCK INTO COMPANY COMMON STOCK IF SUCH CONVERSION WOULD RESULT IN THE OWNERSHIP BY BC PARTNERS OF 5% OR MORE OF THE UNDILUTED COMPANY COMMON STOCK EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (THE OWNERSHIP CAP), UNLESS BC PARTNERS HAVE A GOOD FAITH INTENTION TO SELL AN AMOUNT OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK SUCH THAT THEIR AGGREGATE OWNERSHIP OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF
THE MERGER WILL BE LESS THAN THE OWNERSHIP CAP (SUCH AMOUNT OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK EQUAL TO, OR IN EXCESS OF, THE OWNERSHIP CAP, THE EXCESS AMOUNT) AND HAVE ENTERED INTO SALE AGREEMENTS OR MADE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO
SUCH SALE. IF BC PARTNERS ARE NOT ABLE TO SELL THE EXCESS AMOUNT PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER, THE COMPANY WILL, UPON RECEIPT OF THE REQUIRED LENDER CONSENT UNDER THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT, REPURCHASE FROM BC PARTNERS, AND BC PARTNERS WILL
BE REQUIRED TO SELL TO THE COMPANY, AT A PRICE PER SHARE OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK REPORTED AT THE CLOSE OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE ON THE TRADING DATE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE DATE OF COMPLETION OF THE MERGER, A NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON
STOCK EQUAL TO THE EXCESS AMOUNT.  THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER IS CONDITIONED UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THE VOTING AGREEMENT. AS A RESULT, IF THE PREFERRED STOCK IS NOT REDEEMED OR ANY EXCESS AMOUNT OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK IS NOT REPURCHASED AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE VOTING AGREEMENT, THE MERGER MAY NOT BE COMPLETED. THE COMPANY HAS
AGREED TO USE ITS REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY CONSENT OR WAIVER REQUIRED UNDER THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE VOTING AGREEMENT NO LATER THAN MARCH 6, 2013. 
IN THE VOTING AGREEMENT, BC PARTNERS ALSO AGREED THAT (I) ANY DESIGNEE OF BC PARTNERS TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS NEED
NOT BE AN EMPLOYEE OF BC PARTNERS AND (II) NONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS DESIGNATED BY BC PARTNERS WILL BE MEMBERS OF THE SELECTION COMMITTEE OR PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION OF THE SUCCESSOR CEO. 


IN ADDITION, BC PARTNERS AGREED TO RESTRICTIONS REGARDING THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSFER OR
CONVERT ANY SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK DURING THE PERIOD PRIOR TO THE REQUISITE COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT, AS WELL AS CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS REGARDING THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSFER
ANY OF THE COMPANYS CAPITAL STOCK HELD BY THEM DURING THE PERIOD FOLLOWING SUCH STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL AND THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. BC PARTNERS WILL ALSO BE BOUND BY CERTAIN STANDSTILL PROVISIONS FOR THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING
COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.  THE VOTING AGREEMENT WILL TERMINATE UPON THE EARLIEST TO OCCUR OF (I) THE COMPLETION OF THE
MERGER, (II) CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR WAIVERS BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE MERGER AGREEMENT THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT BC PARTNERS WITHOUT BC PARTNERS CONSENT, INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENT OR WAIVER THAT INCREASES THE EXCHANGE
RATIO OR OTHERWISE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION TO OFFICEMAXS STOCKHOLDERS IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR SHARES OF OFFICEMAX COMMON STOCK AND (III) THE TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS.

ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.  ON JUNE 12, 2013, COOPER TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY, A DELAWARE CORPORATION (THE COMPANY) ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE MERGER AGREEMENT) WITH WHOLLY
OWNED SUBSIDIARIES (THE APOLLO PARTIES) OF APOLLO TYRES LTD (APOLLO). THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, UPON THE TERMS AND SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, AN INDIRECT, WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF
APOLLO WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO THE COMPANY (THE MERGER), WITH THE COMPANY CONTINUING AS THE SURVIVING CORPORATION AND AS AN INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF APOLLO. 
AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER AND AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, EACH SHARE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING
IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE $35.00 IN CASH, WITHOUT INTEREST (THE MERGER CONSIDERATION), PAYABLE TO THE HOLDER OF SUCH SHARE. EACH OPTION TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE
COMPANYS COMMON STOCK, WHETHER VESTED OR UNVESTED, WILL BE CONVERTED AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE A CASH PAYMENT EQUAL TO THE PRODUCT OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO SUCH
OPTION AND THE EXCESS, IF ANY, OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION OVER THE APPLICABLE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE OPTION. EACH OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT WILL BE CONVERTED AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE A CASH PAYMENT EQUAL
TO THE MERGER CONSIDERATION MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE AWARD AGREEMENT FOR SUCH AWARD. EACH OUTSTANDING TIME VESTING RESTRICTED SHARE UNIT WILL BE CONVERTED AT THE
EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE A CASH PAYMENT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE RESTRICTED SHARE UNIT, MULTIPLIED BY THE MERGER CONSIDERATION. ACCOUNT BALANCES, WHETHER VESTED OR
UNVESTED, UNDER ANY COMPANY BENEFIT PLAN THAT PROVIDES FOR THE DEFERRAL OF COMPENSATION AND REPRESENTS AMOUNTS NOTIONALLY INVESTED IN THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK WILL BE CONVERTED AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE CASH
PAYMENT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF NOTIONALLY INVESTED SHARES MULTIPLIED BY THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.  CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER
IS SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OR WAIVER OF CERTAIN CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING (I) ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT BY THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY, (II) EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF ANY APPLICABLE WAITING PERIOD UNDER THE
HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1976, AS AMENDED, AND CERTAIN OTHER FILINGS, CONSENTS AND APPROVALS, (III) THE ABSENCE OF ANY LAW OR ORDER PROHIBITING THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER, (IV) THE ABSENCE OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON THE COMPANY SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2012, (V) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, THE ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND THE APOLLO PARTIES AND (VI) THE PERFORMANCE OR COMPLIANCE BY THE COMPANY AND THE
APOLLO PARTIES WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS. CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER IS NOT SUBJECT TO A FINANCING CONDITION.  EACH OF THE APOLLO PARTIES AND THE COMPANY HAS MADE CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE APOLLO PARTIES AND THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO USE REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS
TO CAUSE THE MERGER TO BE CONSUMMATED. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO AGREED TO VARIOUS COVENANTS IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE DURING THE PERIOD
BETWEEN THE EXECUTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER, (II) TO CALL A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE STOCKHOLDERS TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND (III) NOT TO SOLICIT ALTERNATIVE ACQUISITION PROPOSALS. 
THE MERGER AGREEMENT CONTAINS SPECIFIED TERMINATION RIGHTS FOR THE PARTIES. THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE MERGER AGREEMENT
IF IT ENTERS INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION THAT CONSTITUTES A COMPANY SUPERIOR PROPOSAL (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT), PROVIDED THAT THE COMPANY COMPLIES WITH CERTAIN NOTICE AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS SET
FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING PAYING A TERMINATION FEE TO THE APOLLO PARTIES EQUAL TO $50,000,000. THE COMPANY IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PAY THE APOLLO PARTIES A TERMINATION FEE OF $50,000,000, IF (I) THE APOLLO PARTIES TERMINATE THE
MERGER AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS BECAUSE THE BOARD 



WITHDRAWS OR MODIFIES IN A MANNER ADVERSE TO THE APOLLO PARTIES ITS APPROVAL OR RECOMMENDATION OF THE MERGER OR, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY FAILS TO REAFFIRM ITS APPROVAL OR
RECOMMENDATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT; OR (II) IF (A) THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED BY EITHER PARTY ON OR AFTER THE OUTSIDE DATE (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT), OR IS TERMINATED BY EITHER PARTY BECAUSE THE
STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY DO NOT ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT; (B) PRIOR TO SUCH TERMINATION A COMPANY TAKEOVER PROPOSAL (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT) HAS BEEN MADE AND (C) WITHIN 1 YEAR FOLLOWING SUCH TERMINATION, THE COMPANY
CONSUMMATES A TRANSACTION WITH RESPECT TO SUCH COMPANY TAKEOVER PROPOSAL.  THE MERGER AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES THAT THE APOLLO
PARTIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE COMPANY A REVERSE TERMINATION FEE OF $112.5 MILLION UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT IF THE APOLLO PARTIES HAVE NOT CLOSED THE MERGER WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS OF NOTICE THAT ALL
CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED OR, IF THE COMPLETION OF THE MARKETING PERIOD WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING THAT THE APOLLO PARTIES ARE USING TO FUND A PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED THE COMPLETION OF SUCH MARKETING PERIOD. THE
REVERSE TERMINATION FEE IS FULLY SECURED BY A LETTER OF CREDIT ISSUED BY STANDARD CHARTERED BANK TO THE COMPANY.  THE APOLLO
PARTIES HAVE OBTAINED COMMITTED DEBT FINANCING FROM STANDARD CHARTERED BANK FOR $450.0 MILLION AND COMMITTED DEBT FINANCING FROM MORGAN STANLEY SENIOR FUNDING, INC., DEUTSCHE BANK AG NEW YORK BRANCH, DEUTSCHE BANK AG CAYMAN ISLANDS BRANCH, DEUTSCHE
BANK SECURITIES INC., GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA AND STANDARD CHARTERED BANK FOR $2.375 BILLION, CONSISTING OF A $1.875 BILLION BRIDGE FACILITY AND A $500.0 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE AGGREGATE PROCEEDS OF THE DEBT FINANCING, CERTAIN ADDITIONAL
EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO THE APOLLO PARTIES AND THE COMPANYS CASH ON HAND, WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE APOLLO PARTIES TO PAY THE AGGREGATE MERGER CONSIDERATION AND ALL RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES.

AND IS SUBJECT TO, AND QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY, REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 2.1 AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

SPECIFICALLY, SEGMENT-LEVEL DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WAS INCLUDED.  THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE REFLECTS THE PORTION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OF OUR U.S. AND CANADIAN SEGMENTS.

OUR MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT DISCLOSURE OF THE OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE AND MORE RELEVANT METHOD FOR MEASURING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS INCLUDED IN THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, THAT OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE MORE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, ALONG WITH THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, ARE USED BY OUR MANAGEMENT IN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

OTHER EVENTS.  THIS
CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K IS FILED IN CONNECTION WITH A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING) REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN LITIGATION RELATING TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, DATED AS OF
FEBRUARY 20, 2013 (THE MERGER AGREEMENT), BY AND AMONG OFFICE DEPOT, INC. (OFFICE DEPOT), DOGWOOD MERGER SUB INC., DOGWOOD MERGER SUB LLC, MAPLEBY HOLDINGS MERGER CORPORATION, MAPLEBY MERGER CORPORATION AND OFFICEMAX
INCORPORATED (OFFICEMAX), PROVIDING FOR THE MERGER OF EQUALS BETWEEN OFFICE DEPOT AND OFFICEMAX IN WHICH, THROUGH A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS, OFFICEMAX WILL BECOME AN INDIRECT, WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF OFFICE DEPOT. 
AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-4 OF OFFICE DEPOT, THAT WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE ON JUNE 7, 2013, AND
THE DEFINITIVE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON JUNE 10, 2013 (THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS), EIGHT PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS CHALLENGING THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT WERE FILED ON BEHALF OF A PUTATIVE CLASS CONSISTING OF OFFICEMAX STOCKHOLDERS.  SIX
LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE EIGHTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT OF DUPAGE COUNTY, ILLINOIS (THE STATE COURT): (I) VENKATA S. DONEPUDI V. OFFICEMAX INCORPORATED, ET AL. (CASE NUMBER 2013L000188), FILED ON
FEBRUARY 25, 2013; (II) BETH KOENEKE V. OFFICEMAX INCORPORATED, ET AL. (CASE NUMBER 2013CH000776), FILED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2013; (III) MARC SCHMIDT V. SALIGRAM, ET AL. (CASE NUMBER 2013MR000411), FILED ON MARCH 13, 2013;
(IV) THE FEIVEL & HELENE GOTTLIEB DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN V. OFFICEMAX INCORPORATED, ET AL. (CASE NUMBER 2013L000246), FILED ON MARCH 14, 2013; (V) NORMAN KLUMPP V. BRYANT ET AL. (CASE NUMBER 2013CH1107), FILED ON
MARCH 28, 2013; AND (VI) J. DAVID LEWIS V. OFFICEMAX INCORPORATED, ET AL. (CASE NUMBER 2013CH001123), FILED ON MARCH 29, 2013. THE ABOVE-REFERENCED ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN VENKATA S. DONEPUDI V. OFFICEMAX INCORPORATED, ET
AL. (CASE NUMBER 2013L000188) (THE STATE ACTION). A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN THE STATE ACTION ON APRIL 25, 2013.  TWO LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION: (I) ERIC HOLLANDER V. OFFICEMAX INCORPORATED, ET AL. (CASE NUMBER 1:13-CV-03330),
FILED ON MAY 2, 2013; AND (II) THOMAS AND BEVERLY DEFABIO V. OFFICEMAX INCORPORATED, ET AL. (CASE NUMBER 1:13-CV-03385), FILED ON MAY 6, 2013 (THE FEDERAL ACTIONS). 
THE STATE ACTION AND THE FEDERAL ACTIONS NAMED OFFICE DEPOT, OFFICEMAX AND THE DIRECTORS OF OFFICEMAX, AMONG OTHERS, AS DEFENDANTS. EACH
OF THE LAWSUITS WAS BROUGHT BY A PURPORTED HOLDER OR HOLDERS OF OFFICEMAX COMMON STOCK, BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF A PUTATIVE CLASS OF OFFICEMAX STOCKHOLDERS. THE LAWSUITS GENERALLY ALLEGED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE DIRECTORS OF
OFFICEMAX BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO OFFICEMAX STOCKHOLDERS BY AGREEING TO A TRANSACTION WITH INADEQUATE AND UNFAIR CONSIDERATION AND PURSUANT TO AN INADEQUATE AND UNFAIR PROCESS, AND THAT OFFICE DEPOT AND OFFICEMAX, AMONG OTHERS, AIDED AND
ABETTED THE OFFICEMAX DIRECTORS IN THE BREACH OF THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES. IN ADDITION, THE LAWSUITS ALLEGED THAT THE DISCLOSURE IN THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS WAS INADEQUATE. 
OFFICE DEPOT BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND THAT NO FURTHER DISCLOSURE IS REQUIRED TO SUPPLEMENT THE JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS; HOWEVER, TO ELIMINATE THE BURDEN, EXPENSE AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN SUCH LITIGATION, ON JUNE 25, 2013, THE DEFENDANTS ENTERED INTO THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT OF THE
STATE ACTION AND THE FEDERAL ACTIONS. THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING OUTLINES THE TERMS OF THE PARTIES AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO SETTLE AND RELEASE ALL CLAIMS WHICH WERE OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED IN THE STATE ACTION AND THE FEDERAL ACTIONS.
IN CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH SETTLEMENT AND RELEASE, THE PARTIES TO THE STATE ACTION AND THE FEDERAL ACTIONS HAVE AGREED THAT OFFICE DEPOT AND OFFICEMAX WILL MAKE CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES TO THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, ALL OF WHICH
ARE SET FORTH BELOW. THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING CONTEMPLATES THAT THE PARTIES WILL ATTEMPT IN GOOD FAITH TO AGREE PROMPTLY UPON A STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE STATE COURT FOR APPROVAL AT THE EARLIEST PRACTICABLE TIME. THE
STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT WILL BE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CONDITIONS, INCLUDING APPROVAL BY THE STATE COURT, WHICH WILL CONSIDER THE FAIRNESS, REASONABLENESS AND ADEQUACY OF SUCH SETTLEMENT. THE STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT WILL PROVIDE THAT OFFICEMAX (OR
ITS SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST) WILL PAY, ON BEHALF OF ALL DEFENDANTS, THE PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS FEES AND EXPENSES, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE STATE COURT, IN THE AMOUNT OF $735,000, FOLLOWING DISMISSAL OF BOTH THE STATE ACTION AND THE
FEDERAL ACTIONS WITH PREJUDICE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE PARTIES WILL ULTIMATELY ENTER INTO A 
  2 



STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT OR THAT THE STATE COURT WILL APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT EVEN IF THE PARTIES WERE TO ENTER INTO SUCH STIPULATION. IN SUCH EVENT, OR IF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE
MERGER AGREEMENT ARE NOT CONSUMMATED FOR ANY REASON, THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT WILL BE NULL AND VOID AND OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT. 
SUPPLEMENT TO JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS  IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE STATE ACTION AND THE FEDERAL ACTIONS, AS DESCRIBED IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K, OFFICE DEPOT AND OFFICEMAX HAVE AGREED TO MAKE THESE SUPPLEMENTAL
DISCLOSURES TO THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, WHICH SHOULD BE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY. DEFINED TERMS USED BUT NOT DEFINED BELOW HAVE THE
MEANINGS SET FORTH IN THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.   


1.
THE SECTION OF THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS ENTITLED THE TRANSACTIONSBACKGROUND OF THE TRANSACTIONS IS HEREBY SUPPLEMENTED AS
FOLLOWS:   


 
A.
THE FIRST FULL PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 69 OF THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS (SUCH PARAGRAPH BEGINNING WITH ON JULY 25-26, 2012 . . .) IS HEREBY AMENDED
AND RESTATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:  ON JULY 25-26, 2012, THE OFFICEMAX BOARD OF DIRECTORS MET AT
OFFICEMAXS HEADQUARTERS IN NAPERVILLE, ILLINOIS WITH MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REVIEW OFFICE DEPOTS PROPOSAL FOR A POTENTIAL TRANSACTION IN CONSULTATION WITH SKADDEN, ARPS, SLATE, MEAGHER & FLOM LLP (REFERRED
TO IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AS SKADDEN), WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ENGAGED BY OFFICEMAX IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CORPORATE AND TRANSACTIONAL MATTERS, DECHERT LLP (REFERRED TO IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AS
DECHERT), WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ENGAGED BY OFFICEMAX IN CONNECTION WITH ANTITRUST MATTERS, AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC (REFERRED TO IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AS J.P. MORGAN), WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN
ENGAGED BY OFFICEMAX COMMENCING ON OR AROUND JUNE 1, 2012 IN CONNECTION WITH THE REVIEW OF VARIOUS STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES. AT THIS MEETING, SKADDEN REVIEWED THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE DIRECTORS UNDER DELAWARE LAW, AND DECHERT
PROVIDED A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST MATTERS IN CONNECTION WITH A POSSIBLE TRANSACTION WITH OFFICE DEPOT. J.P. MORGAN DISCUSSED CERTAIN FINANCIAL ANALYSES RELATED TO OFFICEMAXS STRATEGIC PLAN AND VARIOUS CAPITAL STRUCTURE ALTERNATIVES,
AS WELL AS CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO THE PROPOSAL BY OFFICE DEPOT AND POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF STRUCTURING A TRANSACTION WITH OFFICE DEPOT. THE POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF STRUCTURING A TRANSACTION WITH OFFICE DEPOT REVIEWED BY J.P.
MORGAN AT THIS MEETING INCLUDED A TRANSACTION WITH 100% CASH CONSIDERATION PAID BY OFFICE DEPOT, A TRANSACTION IN WHICH OFFICEMAX WOULD ACQUIRE OFFICE DEPOT FOR MIXED CASH AND STOCK CONSIDERATION, AND A MERGER OF EQUALS STOCK FOR STOCK TRANSACTION.
OFFICEMAXS BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A TRANSACTION THAT MIGHT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OFFICEMAXS STOCKHOLDERS. IN PARTICULAR, DIRECTORS DISCUSSED THAT AN ALL-STOCK TRANSACTION UTILIZING A MERGER OF EQUALS
STRUCTURE (INSTEAD OF A PREDOMINANTLY CASH-BASED TRANSACTION) WOULD ENABLE OFFICEMAXS STOCKHOLDERS TO PARTICIPATE PROPORTIONATELY IN POTENTIAL SYNERGIES AT THE COMBINED COMPANY. SEPARATE FROM THE DISCUSSION AROUND THE OFFICE DEPOT TRANSACTION,
CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE CLARIFYING ALTERNATIVES WERE ALSO REVIEWED BY J.P. MORGAN AT THIS MEETING, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE MONETIZATION OF OFFICEMAXS INVESTMENT IN BOISE CASCADE HOLDINGS, L.L.C., RESTRUCTURING OF
THE TIMBER NOTES, THE SALE OF A NON-CORE BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND DIVIDEND POLICY OR SHARE REPURCHASES. AT THIS MEETING, THE OFFICEMAX BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE MIXED CASH AND STOCK CONSIDERATION INDICATED IN OFFICE
DEPOTS JUNE 21, 2012 LETTER DID NOT PRESENT A COMPELLING PROPOSAL GIVEN THE RELATIVE FINANCIAL POSITION AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF THE TWO COMPANIES AT THAT TIME, OFFICEMAX SHOULD CONTINUE TO EXPLORE A POTENTIAL BUSINESS COMBINATION
TRANSACTION WITH OFFICE DEPOT, INCLUDING SEEKING TO STRUCTURE SUCH A TRANSACTION AS AN ALL STOCK MERGER IN ORDER FOR STOCKHOLDERS TO JOINTLY PARTICIPATE IN POTENTIAL SYNERGIES, SECURING EQUAL BOARD REPRESENTATION FOR THE COMBINED COMPANY AND
ADDRESSING OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES SO AS TO PRESERVE OFFICEMAXS BUSINESS FRANCHISE DURING THE REGULATORY REVIEW PERIOD. IN ADDITION, DIRECTORS DISCUSSED THE IMPORTANCE OF CLARIFYING THE POSITION OF BC PARTNERS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMBINED
COMPANY.

B.
THE SEVENTH PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 70 OF THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS (SUCH PARAGRAPH BEGINNING WITH ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2012 . . .), IS HEREBY AMENDED
AND RESTATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:  ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2012, MR. AUSTRIAN SENT A LETTER TO
MR. SALIGRAM IN RESPONSE TO MR. SALIGRAMS SEPTEMBER 4, 2012 LETTER INDICATING THAT ALTHOUGH THE OFFICE DEPOT BOARD OF DIRECTORS DID NOT BELIEVE A PURE MERGER OF EQUALS WAS AN APPROPRIATE CONSTRUCT, IT WAS WILLING TO PROCEED WITH
DISCUSSIONS BASED UPON THE UNDERSTANDING OF A PREDOMINANTLY STOCK FOR STOCK COMBINATION WITH EQUAL BOARD REPRESENTATION AND OTHER INDICIA OF A MERGER OF EQUALS. THE LETTER EXPRESSED OFFICE DEPOTS VIEW THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMPANIES MARKET
CAPITALIZATIONS WERE SIMILAR, BASING A TRANSACTION EXCLUSIVELY ON CURRENT MARKET CAPITALIZATIONS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERVALUE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF OFFICE DEPOT TO A TRANSACTION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT COMPARATIVE REVENUE, EBITDA, NUMBER OF
U.S. STORES AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OFFICE DEPOT DE MÉXICO. THE LETTER PROPOSED A TRANSACTION STRUCTURE THAT WOULD PROVIDE OFFICEMAX STOCKHOLDERS WITH SHARES OF THE COMBINED COMPANY REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 43-45% OF THE COMBINED
COMPANYS OUTSTANDING SHARES (ASSUMING BC PARTNERS DID NOT CONVERT ITS SHARES OF OFFICE DEPOT CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK) AS WELL AS A MODEST CASH COMPONENT (EITHER AS A PRE-TRANSACTION OFFICEMAX SPECIAL DIVIDEND OR AS A PORTION OF THE MERGER
CONSIDERATION). THE LETTER EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT SUCH A STRUCTURE WOULD NOT RESULT IN ONE PARTY BEING VIEWED AS THE ACQUIRER AND THE OTHER AS THE TARGET. AS OF SEPTEMBER 13, 2012, THIS PROPOSED PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP IN THE COMBINED COMPANY
WOULD HAVE REPRESENTED AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF APPROXIMATELY 2.5X-2.7X. THE LETTER INDICATED THAT OFFICE DEPOTS AGREEMENT ON EQUAL BOARD REPRESENTATION ASSUMED THE SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION OF OTHER TRANSACTION PARAMETERS, INCLUDING GOVERNANCE,
MANAGEMENT, HEADQUARTERS AND COMPANY NAME.   


2.
THE SECTION OF THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS ENTITLED THE TRANSACTIONSRECOMMENDATION OF OFFICEMAXS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REASONS FOR
THE TRANSACTIONS IS HEREBY SUPPLEMENTED AS FOLLOWS:   


 
A.
THE FOLLOWING IS HEREBY INSERTED IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF SUCH SECTION ON PAGE 89 OF THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS: 
AS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER  BACKGROUND OF THE TRANSACTIONS, AT VARIOUS TIMES LEADING UP TO THE DETERMINATION TO
ENTER INTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE OFFICEMAX BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON OCCASION CONSIDERED VARIOUS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE POTENTIAL SYNERGIES IN THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH OFFICE DEPOT AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, OFFICEMAX DID NOT
CONDUCT A PRE-SIGNING MARKET CHECK OF OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, SOLICIT ADDITIONAL BIDS OR SEEK TO INCLUDE A GO-SHOP PROVISION IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, OFFICEMAX CONSIDERED THAT, GIVEN THE MERGER OF EQUALS STRUCTURE OF
THE TRANSACTION, PROVISIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT RELATED TO NON-SOLICITATION, RESPONDING TO UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS, CHANGES IN RECOMMENDATION AND TERMINATION RIGHTS AND RELATED FEES AND CONDITIONS WERE STRUCTURED IN A RECIPROCAL MANNER FOR THE
BENEFIT OF OFFICE DEPOT AS WELL AS OFFICEMAX, AND OTHER DEAL PROTECTION TERMS, SUCH A GO SHOP PROVISION, WOULD LIKELY HAVE BEEN REQUESTED TO BE RECIPROCAL TERMS.  AT VARIOUS TIMES LEADING UP TO THE DETERMINATION TO ENTER INTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE OFFICEMAX BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE STOCK PRICES OF BOTH OFFICEMAX AND OFFICE DEPOT AND
CONSIDERED THAT, AS A RESULT OF A FIXED EXCHANGE RATIO, OFFICEMAX STOCKHOLDERS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DECREASE IN THE TRADING PRICE OF OFFICE DEPOT COMMON STOCK DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE TRANSACTIONS. IN VIEW OF THE MERGER OF EQUALS
STRUCTURE OF THE TRANSACTION AND THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF A FIXED EXCHANGE RATIO, OFFICEMAX DID NOT SEEK TO NEGOTIATE FOR A PROTECTIVE COLLAR AS PART OF THE CONSIDERATION IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, INCLUDING THOSE SHOWN IN THE TABLES BELOW (OTHER THAN REVENUE), AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES TO EVALUATE ITS OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE.

ON MAY 7, 2013, DECKERS OUTDOOR CORPORATION MADE THE FOLLOWING LETTER AVAILABLE TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS 2013 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS.  THE LETTER WAS ALSO FILED AS ""DEFINITIVE ADDITIONAL MATERIALS"" ON SCHEDULE 14A WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION:""DEAR STOCKHOLDER:THE ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS OF DECKERS OUTDOOR CORPORATION, A DELAWARE CORPORATION (THE “COMPANY”, “DECKERS”, “WE”, OR “US”), WILL BE HELD AT OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS LOCATED AT 495-A SOUTH FAIRVIEW AVENUE, GOLETA, CALIFORNIA 93117, ON WEDNESDAY, MAY 8, 2013 AT 3:00 P.M. LOCAL TIME (THE “ANNUAL MEETING”).  A NOTICE OF INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS, WHICH PROVIDED CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER PROXY MATERIALS RELATING TO THE ANNUAL MEETING, WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS ON OR ABOUT MARCH 28, 2013. ONE OF THE PROPOSALS SET FORTH IN THE PROXY STATEMENT PROVIDED FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013. SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE THE PROXY STATEMENT WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS, KPMG ADVISED US THAT MR. SCOTT LONDON, A FORMER PARTNER AT KPMG, ALLEGEDLY PROVIDED  NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION TO A THIRD PARTY, WHO THEN USED THE INFORMATION TO TRADE IN SECURITIES OF CERTAIN KPMG CLIENTS, INCLUDING DECKERS.  A CRIMINAL COMPLAINT WAS FILED AGAINST MR. LONDON BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AND A CIVIL COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED AGAINST MR. LONDON BY THE SEC.  WE BECAME AWARE OF THIS INFORMATION ON OR ABOUT APRIL 8, 2013.  MR. LONDON WAS THE PARTNER-IN-CHARGE OF KPMG'S PACIFIC SOUTHWEST BUSINESS UNIT AUDIT PRACTICE AND WAS, ACCORDINGLY, IN THE “CHAIN OF COMMAND” FOR ALL AUDITS PERFORMED WITHIN THAT BUSINESS UNIT, INCLUDING DECKERS.  DURING THE 2009 THROUGH 2011 AUDITING PERIOD, MR. LONDON ALSO WAS AN ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE FOR THE DECKERS ACCOUNT, A ROLE THAT IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS ANY SERVICE OR RELATIONSHIP ISSUES WITH KPMG CLIENTS, BUT WHICH IS RESERVED FOR PARTNERS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE AUDIT ENGAGEMENT FOR THE CLIENT.  MR. LONDON HAD PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS LEAD AUDIT ENGAGEMENT PARTNER FOR DECKERS FOR THE 2001 THROUGH 2003 AUDITS AS WELL AS THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS INTERIM REVIEWS IN 2004.  KPMG SEPARATED MR. LONDON FROM KPMG ON APRIL 5, 2013.BASED UPON ALL OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS AND INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM KPMG, OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE'S REVIEW OF MR. LONDON'S INVOLVEMENT WITH MEMBERS OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE AND THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT TEAM, AND FOLLOWING OUR OWN REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE MATTER, OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS DETERMINED THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE VIOLATION OF THE SEC'S INDEPENDENCE RULES DUE TO MR. LONDON'S ROLE AS PARTNER-IN-CHARGE OF KPMG'S PACIFIC SOUTHWEST BUSINESS UNIT AND HIS ROLE AS AN ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE, MR. LONDON'S ACTIONS DID NOT IMPACT KPMG'S APPLICATION OF OBJECTIVE AND IMPARTIAL JUDGMENT ON ALL ISSUES ENCOMPASSED WITHIN THE AUDITS AND INTERIM REVIEW ENGAGEMENTS PERFORMED BY KPMG FOR DECKERS.  OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT ALL OF OUR PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) FAIRLY PRESENT, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF AND FOR THE FISCAL PERIODS REFERENCED THEREIN, AND (2) MAY CONTINUE TO BE RELIED UPON.  OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED THESE MATTERS WITH KPMG.WHILE WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE KPMG DURING THE 2013 FISCAL YEAR, IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT EVENTS, AND COMPLICATIONS SURROUNDING THE TIMING OF ADEQUATE DISCLOSURE, AS WELL AS THE ACCURATE TABULATION OF VOTES ON THE PROPOSAL FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVENTS, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS PRUDENT TO WITHDRAW THE PROPOSAL TO RATIFY THE SELECTION OF KPMG AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE 2013 FISCAL YEAR.  WE ARE WITHDRAWING THE PROPOSAL SO THAT OUR BOARD IS NOT CONTINUING TO RECOMMEND RATIFICATION OF KPMG, AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS ARE NOT BEING ASKED TO MAKE A VOTING DECISION.  WHILE THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ASKED ITS STOCKHOLDERS TO RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF ITS AUDITOR, THE COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED TO DO SO UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.THE INFORMATION IN THIS LETTER IS INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE PROXY STATEMENT RELATING TO THE ANNUAL MEETING.

FOR THESE REASONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT PRESENTATION OF NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS USEFUL BECAUSE IT GIVES INVESTORS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY'S UNDERLYING CORE BUSINESS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, HOWEVER, SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, SUCH AS THE COMPANY'S GAAP BASIS NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, WHICH ARE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE.ITEM 9.01.

SPECIFICALLY, SEGMENT-LEVEL DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WAS INCLUDED.  THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE REFLECTS THE PORTION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OF OUR U.S. AND CANADIAN SEGMENTS.  IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES WERE INCLUDED:  (I) ADJUSTED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; (II) ADJUSTED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE RATE; (III) ADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN; (IV) ADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN RATE; (V) ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT; (VI) ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT RATE; (VII) ADJUSTED INCOME TAX EXPENSE; (VIII) ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE; (IX) ADJUSTED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS; (X) ADJUSTED NET INCOME; (XI) ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS; AND (XII) ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE.

THE SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2013 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES EXCLUDE FROM THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURES CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP ONLY THE AFTER-TAX LOSS CONTINGENCY ADJUSTMENT OF $0.4 MILLION ($0.01 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE) ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE STORE-RELATED LEGAL MATTER.

WE INTEND TO BEGIN AN ORDERLY WIND-DOWN OF OUR CANADIAN OPERATIONS IMMEDIATELY AND EXPECT THAT PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS WILL CEASE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014.  WE ACQUIRED A STRUGGLING CANADIAN BUSINESS IN FISCAL 2011 WITH THE INTENTION OF REVITALIZING IT, AND HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY TO TURN IT AROUND.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE NOT GAINED THE NECESSARY TRACTION IN THE CANADIAN MARKETPLACE THAT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN ANTICIPATED.  FOLLOWING A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF THE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR OUR CANADIAN OPERATIONS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THE AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS, CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES, AND BASED ON OUR BELIEF THAT CONTINUING TO PURSUE A TURNAROUND WOULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT FURTHER CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND CARRY WITH IT EXECUTION RISK, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND OUR COMPANY TO EXIT THE CANADIAN MARKET.FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013, WE ANTICIPATE A LOSS FROM CANADIAN OPERATIONS IN THE RANGE OF $38 TO $43 MILLION, OR $0.65 TO $0.75 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE.  THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES A CHARGE OF IN THE RANGE OF $32 TO $34 MILLION RELATED TO SEVERANCE ($1 TO $2 MILLION), LEASE LIABILITIES ($6 TO $7 MILLION) AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT FOR FIXED ASSETS AND GOODWILL ($24 TO $25 MILLION). COSTS TO EXIT OUR INVENTORY, INCLUDING ANTICIPATED MARKDOWNS AND IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OUR ESTIMATED LOSS FROM CANADIAN OPERATIONS, AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE RANGE OF $38 TO $43 MILLION, PREVIOUSLY NOTED.  FOR THE FULL YEAR OF FISCAL 2013, WE EXPECT A LOSS FROM OPERATIONS IN THE RANGE OF $52 TO $57 MILLION, OR $0.90 TO $0.98 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE.  WE INTEND TO CLOSE ALL CANADIAN STORES BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014, AND THE ENTIRETY OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE CANADIAN OPERATIONS WILL QUALIFY FOR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS TREATMENT AT THAT TIME.  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014, WE ANTICIPATE A LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE RANGE OF $44 TO $47 MILLION, OR $0.75 TO $0.80 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE.  THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES A CHARGE OF IN THE RANGE OF $39 TO $42 MILLION RELATED TO SEVERANCE ($5 TO $6 MILLION) AND LEASE LIABILITIES ($33 TO $37 MILLION).

CHENGSHAN (SHANDONG) TIRE COMPANY LTD., IN RONGCHENG, CHINA (CCT).  THE CCT AGREEMENT PROVIDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE
UNION AND CHENGSHAN WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO RETURN CCT TO NORMAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTION OF CTB BRANDED PRODUCTS. THIS SUPPORT ALSO INCLUDES PROVIDING CTB WITH ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DATA OF CCT SO THAT CTB MAY PREPARE AND
FILE ITS PERIODIC REPORTS AS REQUIRED UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. FINALLY, THE PARTIES AGREE TO DISMISS ALL PENDING PROCEEDINGS AND WILL NOT COMMENCE ANY NEW PROCEEDINGS WITH REGARD TO ANY EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE JUNE 12, 2013

AGREEMENT, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, PROVIDES CHENGSHAN WITH A LIMITED CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO EITHER (I) PURCHASE COOPER BARBADOS EQUITY INTEREST IN CCT FOR 65% OF THE OPTION PRICE (AS DEFINED BELOW) OR (II) SELL ITS EQUITY INTEREST IN CCT
TO THE COMPANY FOR 35% OF THE OPTION PRICE. IN THE EVENT CHENGSHAN ELECTS NOT TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHT TO PURCHASE COOPER BARBADOS EQUITY INTEREST OR SELL ITS INTEREST IN CCT TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE CHENGSHANS
EQUITY INTEREST IN CCT FOR 35% OF THE OPTION PRICE. THE OPTION PRICE UNDER THE CCT AGREEMENT WILL BE THE GREATER OF (I) THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CCT ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, WHICH VALUE WILL NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE VALUE OF
THE TRADEMARKS AND TECHNOLOGIES LICENSED BY THE COMPANY TO CCT, AS DETERMINED BY AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED VALUATION FIRM (THE CCT VALUATION) AND (II) $435 MILLION, IN EITHER CASE TO BE PAID IN CASH AT CLOSING. THE CCT
AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A PROCESS TO SELECT SUCH INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED VALUATION FIRM. PURSUANT TO THE CCT AGREEMENT, CHENGSHAN MUST NOTIFY THE COMPANY OF ITS ELECTION TO EXERCISE, OR NOT TO EXERCISE, EITHER OF ITS OPTIONS WITHIN 45 DAYS OF THE

ANY OTHER PERIODIC REPORTS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF SUCH REPORTS, THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE FILED AT THAT TIME (SUCH LATER DATE, THE OPTION COMMENCEMENT DATE). 
IF CHENGSHAN DOES NOT EXERCISE ITS OPTIONS WITHIN 45 DAYS AFTER THE OPTION COMMENCEMENT DATE, CHENGSHANS OPTIONS WILL EXPIRE AND THE
COMPANY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO PURCHASE CHENGSHANS EQUITY INTEREST IN CCT FOR A PERIOD OF 90 DAYS FOLLOWING THE OPTION COMMENCEMENT DATE. IF THE CCT VALUATION IS NOT PROVIDED ON OR BEFORE AUGUST 11, 2014,
HOWEVER, THE OPTIONS OF BOTH PARTIES WILL TERMINATE AND BE OF NO EFFECT UNLESS THE COMPANY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, ELECTS TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE FOR THE CCT VALUATION. IN THE EVENT NEITHER CHENGSHAN NOR THE COMPANY EXERCISES THEIR RESPECTIVE
OPTIONS PRIOR TO THEIR EXPIRATION, THEN CHENGSHAN AND THE COMPANY WILL DISCUSS POTENTIAL NEW OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES FOR CCT.  IF CTB IS
UNABLE TO FILE ITS (I) QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2013 BY MARCH 3, 2014 OR (II) ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 BY MARCH 14, 2014, INCLUDING IN EACH
CASE ANY AND ALL REQUIRED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THEN NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR CHENGSHAN WILL BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASE AND/OR SALE OPTIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND SUCH OPTIONS WILL BE NULL AND VOID IMMEDIATELY,
ALTHOUGH THE REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THE CCT AGREEMENT WILL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.  THE CCT AGREEMENT IS SEPARATE AND IN

CHENGSHAN’S DESIGNEE) OF COOPER BARBADOS’ EQUITY INTEREST IN CCT FOR 65% OF THE OPTION PRICE (AS DEFINED BELOW)
OR (II) THE SALE OF CHENGSHAN’S EQUITY INTEREST IN CCT TO THE COMPANY FOR 35% OF THE OPTION PRICE PURSUANT TO THE OPTIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THE CCT AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT
CHENGSHAN ELECTS NOT TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHT TO HAVE PRAIRIE PURCHASE COOPER BARBADOS’ EQUITY INTEREST OR SELL ITS
INTEREST IN CCT TO THE COMPANY OR IS UNABLE TO CONSUMMATE SUCH PURCHASE OR SUCH SALE, THE OPTION AGREEMENT, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, SETS FORTH THE PROCESS FOR THE COMPANY TO EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO PURCHASE CHENGSHAN’S EQUITY INTEREST IN CCT
FOR 35% OF THE OPTION PRICE. THE “OPTION PRICE” UNDER THE CCT AGREEMENT WILL BE THE GREATER OF (I) THE FAIR
MARKET VALUE OF CCT ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, WHICH VALUE WILL NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE VALUE OF THE TRADEMARKS AND
TECHNOLOGIES LICENSED BY THE COMPANY TO CCT, AS DETERMINED BY AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED VALUATION FIRM (THE
“CCT VALUATION”) AND (II) $435 MILLION, IN EITHER CASE TO BE PAID IN CASH AT CLOSING.
 
THE CCT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, IF THE
CCT VALUATION IS NOT PROVIDED ON OR BEFORE AUGUST 11, 2014 (THE “OPTION COMMENCEMENT DEADLINE”), THE
OPTIONS OF BOTH PARTIES WILL TERMINATE AND BE OF NO EFFECT UNLESS THE COMPANY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, ELECTS TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE
FOR THE CCT VALUATION. ON AUGUST 11, 2014, THE COMPANY EXTENDED THE OPTION COMMENCEMENT DEADLINE FROM AUGUST 11, 2014 TO AUGUST
14, 2014 TO ALLOW THE PARTIES TO FINALIZE THE OPTION AGREEMENT AND RELATED MATTERS.
 
THE OPTION AGREEMENT FURTHER EXTENDS THE
OPTION COMMENCEMENT DEADLINE UNTIL AUGUST 24, 2014. FURTHERMORE, THE OPTION AGREEMENT, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, PROVIDES THAT THE DOCUMENTATION
NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE OPTION AGREEMENT ARE TO BE HELD IN ESCROW UNTIL AN OPTION IS EXERCISED
BY CHENGSHAN OR THE COMPANY OR SPECIFIED OTHER EVENTS OCCUR.

A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.THE PRESS RELEASE PRESENTS THE COMPANY’S NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) EXCLUDING THE ITEMS DESCRIBED BELOW.  THESE MEASURES ARE NOT PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”).2014 ADJUSTMENTS•PROGRESSIVE ACQUISITION.  ON APRIL 14, 2014, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF PROGRESSIVE FINANCE HOLDINGS, LLC (“PROGRESSIVE”) FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION.  THE PRESS RELEASE PRESENTS EARNINGS AND EPS EXCLUDING $9.7 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS ESTIMATED ACQUISITION-RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND LEGAL FEES, OF $5.5 MILLION.  THE COMPANY HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED AN ACQUISITION OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROGRESSIVE TRANSACTION.•STRATEGIC MATTERS.  THE COMPANY AND ITS BOARD ADDRESSED VARIOUS STRATEGIC MATTERS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, INCLUDING AN UNSOLICITED ACQUISITION OFFER, TWO PROXY CONTESTS AND SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS.  THE COMPANY INCURRED $12.4 MILLION IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND LEGAL COSTS TO ADDRESS THEM DURING THE SECOND QUARTER.  THESE MATTERS WERE UNPRECEDENTED IN THE COMPANY’S HISTORY, AND THE LEVEL OF THE PROFESSIONAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM WAS SIMILARLY EXCEPTIONAL.•RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED NEW STRATEGY, WHICH INCLUDES AN INITIATIVE TO RATIONALIZE THE COMPANY’S STORE BASE, THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $2.3 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO STORE CLOSURES IN THE SECOND QUARTER.  WHILE THE COMPANY HAS ROUTINELY CLOSED AND SOLD STORES ON AN OPPORTUNISTIC BASIS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS IN THE PAST, AND HAS ALSO DISPOSED OF NON-CORE BUSINESSES IN SUBSTANTIALLY THEIR ENTIRETY, IT HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED A STORE RATIONALIZATION PROGRAM ACROSS THE COMPANY’S ENTIRE CORE BUSINESS, SO MANAGEMENT REGARDS THESE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AS UNUSUAL.2013 ADJUSTMENTS•CALIFORNIA REGULATORY INVESTIGATION.  AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN COOPERATING IN A REGULATORY INVESTIGATION BY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL INTO ITS BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY ACCRUED $15.0 MILLION FOR LOSS CONTINGENCIES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INVESTIGATION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND POTENTIAL COST OF THIS PARTICULAR MATTER DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE COMPANY’S NORMAL COURSE LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.•RETIREMENT AND VACATION RELATED CHARGES.  THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED CHANGES TO ITS RETIREMENT AND VACATION POLICIES LAST YEAR, RESULTING IN $4.9 MILLION IN CHARGES IN THE SECOND QUARTER.  WHILE CHARGES RELATED TO RETIREMENT OR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ACTIONS OR POLICY CHANGES DO ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, MANAGEMENT REGARDS THE CHARGES INCURRED IN THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 AS UNCOMMON IN BOTH NATURE AND SIZE.WHILE SOME OF THE MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED AS NON-RECURRING IN NATURE IN A STRICTLY ACCOUNTING SENSE, MANAGEMENT REGARDS THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAGNITUDE OF THESE MATTERS AS NOT ARISING OUT OF THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND AS NOT, IN ALL CASES, ENTIRELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO PREDICTION OR EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT.  FOR THESE REASONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT PRESENTATION OF NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EPS EXCLUDING THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS USEFUL BECAUSE IT GIVES INVESTORS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY’S UNDERLYING CORE BUSINESS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.THE PRESS RELEASE ALSO PRESENTS PROGRESSIVE’S EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST ON INDEBTEDNESS INCURRED TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION, TAXES AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES (“EBITDA”).  EBITDA IS ALSO NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES PRESENTING THE PROGRESSIVE SEGMENT’S EBITDA IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES SOME INDICATION OF WHAT THE RESULTS OF THE PROGRESSIVE SEGMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSENT THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANY’S ACQUISITION OF PROGRESSIVE, WHICH ARISE PRINCIPALLY FROM THE DEBT FINANCING OF THE TRANSACTION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED ACCOUNTING FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, SUCH AS THE COMPANY’S GAAP BASIS NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EPS AND PROGRESSIVE’S GAAP PRE-TAX LOSS, WHICH ARE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE.ITEM 9.01.

MR. MARKFIELDS ANNUAL BASE SALARY UNDER THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT IS $1,188,000 DURING THE ACTIVE TERM.  IN ADDITION TO HIS BASE
SALARY, MR. MARKFIELD IS ALSO ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

(THE “COMPANY”) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE TO ANNOUNCE ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THREE- AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014. A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.THE PRESS RELEASE PRESENTS THE COMPANY’S NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”) AND IN A FORMAT THAT IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP THAT EXCLUDES THE ITEMS DESCRIBED BELOW.2014 ADJUSTMENTS•PROGRESSIVE ACQUISITION. ON APRIL 14, 2014, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF PROGRESSIVE FINANCE HOLDINGS, LLC (“PROGRESSIVE”) FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION. THE PRESS RELEASE PRESENTS EARNINGS AND EPS EXCLUDING (I) $11.3 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014 AND (II) $9.7 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS, ACQUISITION-RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND LEGAL FEES) OF $5.5 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014. THE COMPANY HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED AN ACQUISITION OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROGRESSIVE TRANSACTION.•RETIREMENT CHARGES. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, RONALD W. ALLEN, FORMERLY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMPANY, RETIRED FROM THE COMPANY, EFFECTIVE AUGUST 31, 2014, AND ON JULY 24, 2014, DAVID L. BUCK, FORMERLY CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE COMPANY, NOTIFIED THE COMPANY THAT HE IS RETIRING AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND IN CONNECTION WITH HIS RETIREMENT RELINQUISHED HIS DUTIES AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1, 2014. THE COMPANY INCURRED $9.1 MILLION IN EXPENSES PERTAINING TO THE RETIREMENT OF THESE TWO OFFICERS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014.  WHILE CHARGES RELATED TO RETIREMENT DO ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, MANAGEMENT REGARDS THE CHARGES INCURRED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014 AS UNCOMMON IN NATURE AND SIZE.•CALIFORNIA REGULATORY INVESTIGATION. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY RESOLVED THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED REGULATORY INVESTIGATION BY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL INTO THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS. THE PRESS RELEASE PRESENTS EARNINGS AND EPS EXCLUDING A $1.2 MILLION REDUCTION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014 OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED REGULATORY EXPENSE UPON SUCH RESOLUTION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND COSTS OF THIS PARTICULAR MATTER DIFFERENTIATED IT FROM THE COMPANY’S NORMAL COURSE LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.•STRATEGIC MATTERS. THE COMPANY AND ITS BOARD ADDRESSED VARIOUS STRATEGIC MATTERS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, INCLUDING AN UNSOLICITED ACQUISITION OFFER, TWO PROXY CONTESTS AND SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS. THE COMPANY INCURRED $12.4 MILLION IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND LEGAL COSTS TO ADDRESS THEM DURING THE SECOND QUARTER. THESE MATTERS WERE UNPRECEDENTED IN THE COMPANY’S HISTORY, AND THE LEVEL OF THE PROFESSIONAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM WAS SIMILARLY EXCEPTIONAL.•RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED NEW STRATEGY, WHICH INCLUDES AN INITIATIVE TO RATIONALIZE THE COMPANY’S STORE BASE, THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $6.9 MILLION AND $2.3 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO STORE CLOSURES IN THE THIRD AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2014, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS ROUTINELY CLOSED AND SOLD STORES ON AN OPPORTUNISTIC BASIS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS IN THE PAST, AND HAS ALSO DISPOSED OF NON-CORE BUSINESSES IN SUBSTANTIALLY THEIR ENTIRETY, IT HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED A STORE RATIONALIZATION PROGRAM ACROSS THE COMPANY’S ENTIRE CORE BUSINESS, SO MANAGEMENT REGARDS THESE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AS UNUSUAL.2013 ADJUSTMENTS•CALIFORNIA REGULATORY INVESTIGATION.  THE COMPANY ACCRUED $13.4 MILLION AND $15.0 MILLION FOR LOSS CONTINGENCIES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOW-RESOLVED INVESTIGATION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013 AND SECOND QUARTER OF 2013, RESPECTIVELY. •RETIREMENT AND VACATION RELATED CHARGES. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, WILLIAM K. BUTLER, JR., FORMERLY CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE COMPANY, RETIRED FROM THE COMPANY EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2013. THE COMPANY ALSO IMPLEMENTED CHANGES TO ITS VACATION POLICIES LAST YEAR. THE COMPANY RECORDED $4.9 MILLION IN CHARGES IN THE SECOND QUARTER RELATED TO THIS RETIREMENT AND CHANGE IN VACATION POLICIES. WHILE CHARGES RELATED TO RETIREMENT OR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ACTIONS OR POLICY CHANGES DO ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, MANAGEMENT REGARDS THE CHARGES INCURRED IN THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 AS UNCOMMON IN BOTH NATURE AND SIZE.WHILE SOME OF THE MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED AS NON-RECURRING IN NATURE IN A STRICTLY ACCOUNTING SENSE, MANAGEMENT REGARDS THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAGNITUDE OF THESE MATTERS AS NOT ARISING OUT OF THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND AS NOT ENTIRELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO PREDICTION OR EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT. FOR THESE REASONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT PRESENTATION OF NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EPS EXCLUDING THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS USEFUL BECAUSE IT GIVES INVESTORS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY’S UNDERLYING CORE BUSINESS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.THE PRESS RELEASE ALSO PRESENTS THE EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF EACH OF THE COMPANY’S SEGMENTS, ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE PROGRESSIVE-RELATED TRANSACTION COSTS, FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND LEGAL COSTS RELATED TO STRATEGIC MATTERS, RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT AND VACATION-RELATED CHARGES AND REVERSAL OF REGULATORY EXPENSE RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL INVESTIGATION DESCRIBED ABOVE (“ADJUSTED EBITDA”). ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO NOT A MEASURE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES PRESENTING THE COMPANY’S ADJUSTED EBITDA IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES SOME INDICATION OF WHAT THE RESULTS OF PROGRESSIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSENT THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANY’S ACQUISITION OF PROGRESSIVE, WHICH ARISE PRINCIPALLY FROM THE DEBT FINANCING OF THE TRANSACTION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED ACCOUNTING FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  IT ALSO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON WHAT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSENT THE PROGRESSIVE ACQUISITION AND THE AFOREMENTIONED SPECIAL CHARGES.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, SUCH AS THE COMPANY’S GAAP BASIS NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EPS AND THE GAAP OPERATING INCOME OF THE COMPANY’S SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIESON JULY 15, 2014, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT A RIGOROUS EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY-OPERATED STORE PORTFOLIO HAD BEEN PERFORMED, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE CLOSING OF 44 UNDERPERFORMING STORES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014. THE RESTRUCTURING WAS COMPLETED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014 AND TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $9.1 MILLION WERE RECORDED DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, PRINCIPALLY COMPRISED OF $4.8 MILLION RELATED TO CONTRACTUAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS, $3.3 MILLION RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF AND IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND $600,000 RELATED TO WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS.

THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE TO MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY’S SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND OTHER EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO EACH RECIPIENT WILL BE SET FORTH IN SEPARATE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENTS (EACH, AN “OPTION AGREEMENT”), THE FORM OF WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. IN ESTABLISHING THE TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WORKED CLOSELY WITH ITS INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT AND OTHER ADVISORS TO ENSURE THAT THE AWARDS SUPPORT THE COMPANY’S COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES.  IN APPROVING THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE SHIFTED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE TOTAL EQUITY GRANTS MADE TO ITS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 FROM PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO PERFORMANCE-BASED STOCK OPTIONS. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS CLOSELY ALIGN THE VALUE THAT MAY BE REALIZED BY AWARD RECIPIENTS UNDER THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS WITH STOCKHOLDER VALUE SINCE THEY ARE GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE GRANT DATE, AND ONLY HAVE VALUE TO THE RECIPIENT TO THE EXTENT THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S STOCK GOES UP OVER TIME.  THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OR OTHER FULL VALUE AWARDS THAT MAY RESULT IN VALUE TO THE RECIPIENT EVEN WHERE THE STOCK PRICE DOES NOT INCREASE. PURSUANT TO THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS, EACH RECIPIENT WILL BE GRANTED THE OPTION TO PURCHASE A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK AT A FIXED EXERCISE PRICE PER SHARE, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMMON STOCK ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE ON THE GRANT DATE.  THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS WILL VEST AS TO 100% OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES UPON A DETERMINATION BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE THAT THE COMPANY HAS ACHIEVED A PRE-ESTABLISHED “PRE-TAX INCOME” (AS DEFINED IN THE OPTION AGREEMENT) TARGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2019 (THE “PERFORMANCE CRITERIA”).  IF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THAT THE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED AT THE TARGET LEVEL, NO VESTING WILL OCCUR AND ALL OF THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS WILL EXPIRE IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ACTION BY THE COMPANY OR THE RECIPIENT.  IN ADDITION, IN ORDER FOR THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS TO VEST, THE RECIPIENT MUST PROVIDE “CONTINUOUS SERVICE” (AS DEFINED IN THE OPTION AGREEMENT) TO THE COMPANY THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019, SUBJECT TO LIMITED EXCEPTIONS AS DESCRIBED IN THE OPTION AGREEMENT.  THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THIS STRUCTURE WILL PROMOTE RETENTION OF EXECUTIVES BECAUSE THE PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTIONS WILL VEST BASED ON A PERFORMANCE TARGET TO BE ACHIEVED IN THE FUTURE. PURSUANT TO THE ""DOUBLE TRIGGER"" VESTING PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THE OPTION AGREEMENT, THE VESTING OF EACH PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTION WILL BE ACCELERATED IN FULL IN THE EVENT OF A “CORPORATE TRANSACTION” (AS DEFINED IN THE 2015 PLAN) IF THE ACQUIRING OR SUCCESSOR ENTITY IN THE CORPORATE TRANSACTION PROVIDES FOR THE CONTINUANCE OR ASSUMPTION OF THE OPTION AGREEMENT, OR THE SUBSTITUTION FOR THE OPTION AGREEMENT OF A NEW AGREEMENT OF COMPARABLE VALUE COVERING SHARES OF A SUCCESSOR CORPORATION (""NEW INCENTIVES""), AND THE RECIPIENT IS TERMINATED BY THE ACQUIRING COMPANY WITHOUT “CAUSE” OR PURSUANT TO A “CONSTRUCTIVE TERMINATION” (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE OPTION AGREEMENT) WITHIN 12 MONTHS  OF SUCH CORPORATE TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, THE VESTING OF EACH PERFORMANCE OPTION WILL BE ACCELERATED IN FULL IF: (I) A CORPORATE TRANSACTION OCCURS THAT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY A MAJORITY OF THE CONTINUING DIRECTORS (AS DEFINED IN THE OPTION AGREEMENT); (II) THE ACQUIRING OR SUCCESSOR ENTITY IN THE CORPORATE TRANSACTION DOES NOT AGREE TO PROVIDE FOR THE CONTINUANCE OR ASSUMPTION OF THE OPTION AGREEMENT, OR THE SUBSTITUTION FOR THE OPTION AGREEMENT OF A NEW AGREEMENT OF COMPARABLE VALUE COVERING NEW INCENTIVES, OR (III) THE RECIPIENT SHALL HAVE PROVIDED CONTINUOUS SERVICE THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019.
