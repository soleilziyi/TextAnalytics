THE INITIAL ACQUISITION OF MEDIAN WAS COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 15, 2014 WHEN AN AFFILIATE OF WATERLAND PRIVATE
EQUITY FUND V C.V. (WATERLAND V) ACQUIRED 94.9% OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS IN MEDIAN AND WE INDIRECTLY ACQUIRED THE REMAINING 5.1% OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS IN MEDIAN. IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING, WE PROVIDED
INTERIM ACQUISITION LOANS TO WATERLAND V AND MEDIAN IN AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY 425 MILLION ($531 MILLION). IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT, WE REFER TO THE DECEMBER 15, 2014 ACQUISITION OF MEDIAN AND RELATED FINANCING
TRANSACTIONS AS THE INITIAL MEDIAN CLOSING.  IN A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS WE EXPECT WILL BE COMPLETED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, WE WILL
ACQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF MEDIANS REAL ESTATE ASSETS IN SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN US AND MEDIAN. WE WILL LEASE THE ASSETS BACK TO MEDIAN UNDER A 27 YEAR MASTER LEASE, WITH ANNUAL ESCALATORS AT THE GREATER OF ONE PERCENT OR 70% OF
THE GERMAN CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. THE INITIAL GAAP YIELD IS 9.3%, WHICH INCLUDES THE STRAIGHT LINE REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MINIMUM ANNUAL RENT ESCALATOR. THE INTERIM LOANS THAT WE PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL MEDIAN CLOSING BEAR
INTEREST AT A RATE SIMILAR TO THE INITIAL LEASE RATE WE WILL RECEIVE UNDER THE SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS. IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT, WE REFER TO THE SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS AS THE MEDIAN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS. 
UPON CLOSING OF THE MEDIAN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS, THE INTERIM LOANS THAT WE PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL MEDIAN CLOSING WILL BE CONVERTED AND
OFFSET AGAINST THE REAL ESTATE PURCHASE PRICE PAYABLE BY US. THE PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH WILL NOT EXCEED 705 MILLION ($881 MILLION) IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL BE FURTHER REDUCED AND OFFSET AGAINST AMOUNTS OF DEBT THAT WE ELECT TO ASSUME OR
PROVIDE CASH TO REPAY IN CONNECTION WITH CLOSING. THE MEDIAN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY REAL ESTATE, REGULATORY AND OTHER CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WAIVER OF ANY STATUTORY PRE-EMPTION RIGHTS BY LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES. TO THE
EXTENT WE ARE UNABLE TO ACQUIRE THE ENTIRE MEDIAN REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MEDIAN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS, WE WILL HAVE A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL WITH REGARD TO ANY NEW REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES OWNED OR ACQUIRED BY MEDIAN, UNTIL WE
HAVE ACQUIRED REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES FROM MEDIAN FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF AT LEAST 705 MILLION ($881 MILLION).  IN THIS PROSPECTUS
SUPPLEMENT, WE REFER TO THE INITIAL MEDIAN CLOSING AND THE MEDIAN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS, ALONG WITH THE RELATED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, COLLECTIVELY AS THE MEDIAN TRANSACTIONS. 
WATERLAND V IS AN AFFILIATE OF WATERLAND PRIVATE EQUITY FUND IV C.V. (WATERLAND IV), WHICH CONTROLS RHM KLINIK-UND ALTENHEIMBETRIEBE
GMBH & CO. KG (RHM), THE OPERATOR AND LESSEE OF 14 GERMAN FACILITIES THAT WE CURRENTLY OWN. ON DECEMBER 18, 2014, WATERLAND PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, THE PARENT COMPANY OF WATERLAND V AND WATERLAND IV, ANNOUNCED ITS
INTENT TO MERGE MEDIAN AND RHM DURING THE COURSE OF 2015. PRO FORMA FOR THE MERGER, AND AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE MEDIAN TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN FOURTH QUARTER TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED BELOW (ASSUMING FULL FUNDING OF OUR REMAINING DEVELOPMENT
COMMITMENTS), THE COMBINED MEDIAN-RHM PORTFOLIO WILL REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 27% OF OUR PORTFOLIO BY INVESTMENT AMOUNT.  FINANCING 
WE BORROWED $533 MILLION UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, ALONG WITH CASH ON HAND, TO FUND THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY US IN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL MEDIAN
CLOSING, IN ADDITION TO RELATED COSTS, FEES AND EXPENSES. WE INTEND TO USE ALL OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO REPAY A PORTION OF THE AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. 
DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF MEDIANS REAL ESTATE ASSETS IN THE MEDIAN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS DESCRIBED
ABOVE FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY 705 MILLION ($881 MILLION), PLUS AN ESTIMATED 60.3 MILLION ($75.3 MILLION) IN RELATED TRANSACTION COSTS, FEES AND EXPENSES. THE INTERIM LOANS OF APPROXIMATELY
425 MILLION ($531 MILLION) THAT WE PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH 
  3 



THE INITIAL MEDIAN CLOSING WILL BE CONVERTED AND OFFSET AGAINST THE REAL ESTATE PURCHASE PRICE UNDER THE MEDIAN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS. WE INTEND TO FINANCE THE REMAINING APPROXIMATELY
280 MILLION ($350 MILLION) OF THE PURCHASE PRICE (PLUS THE RELATED COSTS, FEES AND EXPENSES) WITH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE ASSUMPTION OF EXISTING MEDIAN DEBT AND/OR WITH FUNDS FROM ADDITIONAL FINANCING
ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE BORROWINGS OR NET PROCEEDS FROM SENIOR DEBT FACILITIES OR ISSUANCES, ASSUMPTION OF EXISTING OR PLACEMENT OF NEW SECURED LOANS ON THE MEDIAN REAL ESTATE, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF. THE SOURCES OF FINANCING ACTUALLY USED
WILL DEPEND UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THEN-CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS.  CREDIT FACILITY AMENDMENT AND UPSIZE 
ON OCTOBER 17, 2014, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT TO INCREASE THE CURRENT AGGREGATE COMMITTED SIZE OF THE
FACILITY TO $1.15 BILLION AND INCREASE THE INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN AND/OR REVOLVING LOAN CAPACITY BY UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $400 MILLION, FOR TOTAL AGGREGATE CAPACITY OF $1.55 BILLION. THE AMENDMENT ALSO INCREASES THE ALTERNATIVE CURRENCY SUBLIMIT UNDER
THE FACILITY TO 500 MILLION AND AMENDS CERTAIN COVENANTS IN ORDER TO PERMIT US TO CONSUMMATE AND FINANCE THE MEDIAN TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, WE ALSO HAVE COMMITMENTS FROM A SYNDICATE OF LENDERS FOR A SENIOR UNSECURED INTERIM
LOAN FACILITY WITH CURRENT AVAILABILITY OF UP TO $215 MILLION.  OTHER ACQUISITIONS / TRANSACTIONS 
ON OCTOBER 31, 2014, WE ACQUIRED A 237-BED ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL AND ASSOCIATED MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS AND A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACILITY IN SHERMAN, TEXAS
FOR $32.5 MILLION. ALECTO HEALTHCARE SERVICES IS THE TENANT AND OPERATOR PURSUANT TO A 15-YEAR LEASE AGREEMENT WITH THREE FIVE-YEAR EXTENSION OPTIONS. IN ADDITION WE AGREED TO FUND A WORKING CAPITAL LOAN UP TO $7.5 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH WAS FUNDED
DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, WE ACQUIRED THREE RHM REHABILITATION FACILITIES IN GERMANY FOR AN AGGREGATE
PURCHASE PRICE OF 63.6 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $79.5 MILLION), INCLUDING REAL ESTATE TRANSFER TAXES. THESE FACILITIES INCLUDE: BAD LIEBENSTEIN (271 BEDS), BAD TOLZ (248 BEDS) AND BAD MERGENTHEIM (211 BEDS). ALL THREE PROPERTIES ARE
INCLUDED UNDER OUR EXISTING MASTER LEASE AGREEMENT WITH RHM.  ON DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE COMPLETED THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR INVESTMENT IN MONROE
HOSPITAL, LOCATED IN BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA, BY ENTERING INTO A LEASE WITH AN AFFILIATE OF PRIME HEALTHCARE SERVICES (PRIME) FOR THE OPERATION OF THE FACILITY. THE LEASE WAS INCLUDED UNDER OUR EXISTING MASTER LEASE WITH PRIME, WHICH HAS
MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS REMAINING ON THE FIXED TERM AND CONTAINS TWO RENEWAL OPTIONS OF FIVE YEARS EACH. THE LEASE RATE FOR THE MONROE FACILITY IS BASED ON A $30 MILLION INVESTMENT VALUE AND ESCALATES ANNUALLY AT THE GREATER OF THE CONSUMER PRICE
INDEX INCREASE OR 2%. WE PAID $5.0 MILLION FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH ENTERING INTO THE LEASE WITH PRIME AND PRIME HAS THE OPTION TO ACQUIRE THE FACILITY FOR $30 MILLION AT ANY TIME UPON 90 DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE. 
IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT WE REFER TO THE ACQUISITIONS IN SHERMAN, TEXAS, THE ACQUISITION OF THE THREE GERMAN RHM REHABILITATION FACILITIES AND THE LEASE
WITH PRIME OF MONROE HOSPITAL AS THE FOURTH QUARTER TRANSACTIONS.

BENEFITS OF MEDIAN AND FOURTH QUARTER TRANSACTIONS 
ENHANCES SIZE, QUALITY AND DIVERSITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO. AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW, WE BELIEVE THAT THE MEDIAN TRANSACTIONS AND THE FOURTH QUARTER
TRANSACTIONS WILL ENHANCE THE SIZE AND QUALITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE PORTFOLIO AND ADD DIVERSITY BY PROPERTY TYPE, OPERATOR AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION:   









  



 (1) INCLUDES FREESTANDING EMERGENCY ROOMS.   









  



 NOTE: PERCENTAGES IN ALL CHARTS ARE BASED ON OUR TOTAL GROSS ASSETS, ASSUMING DEVELOPMENT COMMITMENTS ARE FULLY FUNDED. 
ACCRETIVE TRANSACTIONS. THE MEDIAN TRANSACTIONS AND THE FOURTH QUARTER TRANSACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IMMEDIATELY ACCRETIVE TO CASH AVAILABLE FOR
DISTRIBUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS, RESULTING IN AN IMPROVED PAYOUT RATIO AND STRONGER SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR DIVIDENDS.  EXPANDS OUR SIZE AND
SCALE. THE MEDIAN TRANSACTIONS, WHEN CONSUMMATED, AND THE FOURTH QUARTER TRANSACTIONS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND OUR TOTAL GROSS ASSETS BY APPROXIMATELY 35% TO $4.5 BILLION (ASSUMING DEVELOPMENT COMMITMENTS ARE FULLY FUNDED), INCREASE
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PROPERTIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO BY APPROXIMATELY 40% TO 172, AND INCREASE OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF BEDS BY APPROXIMATELY 95% TO NEARLY 20,000. 
INCREASES OUR TOTAL REVENUES. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, OUR TOTAL REVENUES WERE $230.4 MILLION UNDER GAAP. ASSUMING
CONSUMMATION ON JANUARY 1, 2014 OF THE MEDIAN TRANSACTIONS AND THE FOURTH QUARTER TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED DURING 2014, OUR PRO FORMA TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED
SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $310.6 MILLION (EXCLUDING ADDITIONAL REVENUES RECEIVED FROM OUR DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES THAT BEGAN OPERATIONS DURING 2014).

EXTENDS OUR LEASE MATURITY SCHEDULE. THE MEDIAN TRANSACTIONS AND THE FOURTH QUARTER TRANSACTIONS WILL HAVE
THE EFFECT OF EXTENDING OUR OVERALL WEIGHTED AVERAGE LEASE EXPIRATION FROM 12.9 YEARS TO 16.5 YEARS, PRO FORMA AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2014. PRO FORMA FOR THE MEDIAN TRANSACTIONS AND FOURTH QUARTER TRANSACTIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2014,
APPROXIMATELY 72.4% OF THE TOTAL ANNUALIZED RENT OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES WILL HAVE LEASE EXPIRATIONS BEYOND 2025, WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL LEASE MATURITIES OF LESS THAN 1.3% PER ANNUM THROUGH 2021. 
FURTHER INCREASES OUR EXPOSURE TO FAVORABLE MARKET TRENDS IN WESTERN EUROPE. AS ONE OF THE STRONGEST GLOBAL ECONOMIES, WITH LOW UNEMPLOYMENT
RATES AND UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE COVERAGE AND PAYMENT POLICIES, WE BELIEVE GERMANY REMAINS A FAVORABLE MARKET IN WHICH TO INVEST. THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS ARE MAKING CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENTS IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY IN GERMANY, AND
WE EXPECT TO REALIZE SIGNIFICANT VALUE AND LONG-TERM STABILITY THROUGH OUR INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN THE REGION. AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE MEDIAN TRANSACTIONS AND FOURTH QUARTER TRANSACTIONS AND ASSUMING DEVELOPMENT COMMITMENTS ARE FULLY FUNDED,
APPROXIMATELY 28% OF OUR PORTFOLIO BY INVESTMENT AMOUNT, OR A TOTAL OF 55 FACILITIES, WILL BE LOCATED IN WESTERN EUROPE.

THE MODIFIED GUIDANCE DISCLOSED IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2015 AND THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2015 IS BASED UPON A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SUFFICIENTLY SPECIFIC AND ARE REASONABLE, THEY ARE NEVERTHELESS SUBJECT TO BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE UNCERTAINTIES.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY’S ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES.  IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SET FORTH IN OUR PERIODIC FILINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”).  A RECONCILIATION OF PROJECTED DILUTED EPS TO PROJECTED FFOPS FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2015 AND THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2015 IS PROVIDED, AS FOLLOWS: THREE MONTHS ENDING YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2015 DECEMBER 31, 2015 LOW HIGH 1,230 HIGHEPS$0.10 $0.12 $1.23 $1.29REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION0.35 0.35 1.50 1.50FFOPS, NAREIT DEFINITION0.45 0.47 2.73 2.79OPERATING PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01NOI FROM PROPERTIES TO BE CONVEYED (A)(0.01) (0.01) (0.04) (0.04)INTEREST EXPENSE ON LOAN SECURED BY PROPERTIES TO BE CONVEYED (A)0.03 0.03 0.12 0.12GAINS ON SALES OF UNDEPRECIATED PROPERTIES(0.04) (0.04) (0.04) (0.04)NET GAINS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT (B)— — (0.81) (0.81)FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY$0.44 $0.46 $1.97 $2.03        A.THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO TRANSFER TWO OPERATING PROPERTIES IN SATISFACTION OF NON-RECOURSE SECURED INDEBTEDNESS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE MEASURES ARE HELPFUL TO INVESTORS IN MEASURING ITS PERFORMANCE AND COMPARING SUCH PERFORMANCE TO OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (“REITS”).  SINCE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS INCLUDABLE IN NET INCOME, RELIANCE ON THE MEASURES HAS LIMITATIONS; MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY USING THE MEASURES SIMPLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ARE WEIGHED IN BALANCE WITH OTHER GAAP AND NON-GAAP MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIONS OF THE COMPANY’S CASH FLOW AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH NEEDS.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR PAY DEBT SERVICE.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (“FFO” OR “FFO PER NAREIT”) DEFINED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) COMPUTED USING GAAP, EXCLUDING GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  WHEN MULTIPLE PROPERTIES CONSISTING OF BOTH OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING PROPERTIES EXIST ON A SINGLE TAX PARCEL, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ALL OF THE GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, THE TAX PARCEL AS ALL BEING FOR PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES WHEN MOST OF THE VALUE OF THE PARCEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING PROPERTIES ON THE PARCEL.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT USES THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST’S (“NAREIT”) DEFINITION OF FFO, ALTHOUGH OTHERS MAY INTERPRET THE DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY’S PRESENTATION OF FFO MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO IS USEFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE, BY EXCLUDING GAINS RELATED TO SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, FFO CAN HELP ONE COMPARE ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFO.BASIC FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“BASIC FFO”) THIS MEASURE IS FFO ADJUSTED TO SUBTRACT (1) PREFERRED SHARE DIVIDENDS, (2) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF PREFERRED UNITS IN CORPORATE OFFICE PROPERTIES, L.P. (THE “OPERATING PARTNERSHIP”) OR INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES NOT OWNED BY THE COMPANY, (3) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ALLOCABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES, (4) BASIC FFO ALLOCABLE TO RESTRICTED SHARES AND (5) ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS, BASIC FFO REPRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND HOLDERS OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP (“COMMON UNITS”).  COMMON UNITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE COMPANY’S COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST (“COMMON SHARES”) AND ARE EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASIC FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS DUE TO THE CLOSE CORRELATION OF COMMON UNITS TO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO BASIC FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“DILUTED FFO”) DILUTED FFO IS BASIC FFO ADJUSTED TO ADD BACK ANY CHANGES IN BASIC FFO THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE ASSUMED CONVERSION OF SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED FFO ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT IS THE NUMERATOR USED TO COMPUTE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE, DISCUSSED BELOW.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO DILUTED FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY (“DILUTED FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY”) AND FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY DEFINED AS DILUTED FFO OR FFO ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE: OPERATING PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS: GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PROPERTIES OTHER THAN PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES, NET OF ASSOCIATED INCOME TAX; GAIN OR LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; FFO ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTIES SECURING NON-RECOURSE DEBT ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DEFAULTED AND WHICH THE COMPANY HAS EXTINGUISHED, OR EXPECTS TO EXTINGUISH, VIA CONVEYANCE OF THOSE PROPERTIES (INCLUDING PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND GAINS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT); LOSS ON INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES; EXECUTIVE TRANSITION COSTS; AND ACCOUNTING CHARGES FOR ORIGINAL ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS AND, AS A RESULT, BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE ADJUSTMENT FOR FFO ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTIES SECURING NON-RECOURSE DEBT ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DEFAULTED PERTAINS TO THE PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO ITS DEFAULT ON THE LOAN’S PAYMENT TERMS, WHICH IS THE RESULT OF ITS DECISION TO NOT SUPPORT PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN.  WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUES AS THE LEGAL OWNER OF THE PROPERTIES DURING THIS PERIOD, ALL CASH FLOWS PRODUCED BY THE PROPERTIES GO DIRECTLY TO THE LENDER AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT FUND ANY DEBT SERVICE SHORTFALLS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE.DILUTED FFO PER SHARE (“FFOPS”)FFOPS IS (1) DILUTED FFO DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE COMPUTATION OF FFOPS ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFOPS IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH A FURTHER CONTEXT FOR EVALUATING OUR FFO RESULTS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT INVESTORS USE EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) IN EVALUATING NET (LOSS) INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFOPS.FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITYDEFINED AS (1) DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE COMPUTATION OF THIS MEASURE ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE THE PER SHARE MEASURE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS.  AS SUCH, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE.FORWARD‑LOOKING STATEMENTSTHIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K CONTAINS “FORWARD‑LOOKING” STATEMENTS, WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND SECTION 21E OF THE EXCHANGE ACT THAT ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY’S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND FINANCIAL TRENDS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS BUSINESS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE USE OF WORDS SUCH AS “MAY,” “WILL,” “SHOULD,” “COULD,” “BELIEVE,” “ANTICIPATE,” “EXPECT,” “ESTIMATE,” “PLAN” OR OTHER COMPARABLE TERMINOLOGY.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE INHERENTLY SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, MANY OF WHICH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY AND SOME OF WHICH THE COMPANY MIGHT NOT EVEN ANTICIPATE.  ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS REFLECTED IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS AT THE TIME MADE, THE COMPANY CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS WILL BE ACHIEVED.  ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ADDRESSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

OMEGA’S MANAGEMENT HAS PREPARED
THE ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 PRESENTED ABOVE IN GOOD FAITH BASED UPON THE MOST RECENT
INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO OMEGA’S MANAGEMENT FROM OMEGA’S INTERNAL REPORTING PROCEDURES AS OF THE DATE OF THIS DOCUMENT.
THE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATED RANGES SET FORTH HEREIN ARE PRELIMINARY, UNAUDITED, SUBJECT TO FURTHER COMPLETION AND REFLECT OMEGA’S
CURRENT GOOD FAITH ESTIMATES, DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OR GIVE PRO FORMA EFFECT TO THE MERGER, AS DEFINED BELOW, WITH
AVIV REIT INC. (“AVIV”), ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL CLOSING PROCEDURES AND MAY BE REVISED AS A
RESULT OF OMEGA MANAGEMENT’S FURTHER REVIEW OF OMEGA’S RESULTS AND ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE COMPLETION
OF THE AUDIT OF THE FISCAL 2014 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY AND ITS AUDITORS HAVE NOT COMPLETED THEIR NORMAL
QUARTERLY REVIEW OR ANNUAL AUDIT PROCEDURES AS OF AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND THERE CAN
BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR FINAL RESULTS FOR THIS QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL PERIOD WILL NOT DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. ANY SUCH CHANGES
COULD BE MATERIAL. DURING THE COURSE OF THE PREPARATION OF OMEGA’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES AS
OF AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND THEIR AUDIT, OMEGA MAY IDENTIFY ITEMS THAT WOULD REQUIRE
OMEGA TO MAKE MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED ABOVE.
OMEGA’S CONSOLIDATED
          FINANCIAL           STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES AS OF AND FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 ARE NOT
          EXPECTED TO BE           FILED WITH THE SEC UNTIL AFTER THIS OFFERING IS COMPLETED. OMEGA’S ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER
          MATERIALLY FROM THE FOURTH           QUARTER AND YEAR END ESTIMATES ABOVE. ACCORDINGLY, YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE
          ON THESE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES.           THESE ESTIMATES SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR FULL AUDITED OR INTERIM
          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE           WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (“GAAP”). IN ADDITION, THESE
          PRELIMINARY           ESTIMATES           AS OF AND           FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
          2014 ARE NOT           NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF           THE RESULTS TO BE           ACHIEVED FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.
          FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE           THESE           PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES TO           DIFFER INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

OMEGA CALCULATES AND REPORTS FFO
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DEFINITION AND INTERPRETIVE GUIDELINES ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS,
(“NAREIT”), AND CONSEQUENTLY, FFO IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, ADJUSTED FOR THE
EFFECTS OF ASSET DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS, PRIMARILY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS ON REAL ESTATE
ASSETS. OMEGA BELIEVES THAT FFO, ADJUSTED FFO AND FAD ARE IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE
THE HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING CONVENTION USED FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS REQUIRES DEPRECIATION (EXCEPT ON LAND), SUCH ACCOUNTING
PRESENTATION IMPLIES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME, WHILE REAL ESTATE VALUES INSTEAD HAVE
HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS. THE TERM FFO WAS DESIGNED BY THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.
FFO DESCRIBED HEREIN IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO FFO OF OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (“REITS”), THAT DO NOT USE
THE SAME DEFINITION OR IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES OR INTERPRET THE STANDARDS DIFFERENTLY FROM OMEGA.
OMEGA USES FFO, ADJUSTED
        FFO AND FAD AMONG OTHER CRITERIA TO MEASURE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF ITS BUSINESS. OMEGA FURTHER BELIEVES THAT
        BY EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, IMPAIRMENTS ON REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALES
        OF REAL ESTATE, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL COSTS AND WHICH MAY BE OF LIMITED RELEVANCE IN EVALUATING CURRENT
        PERFORMANCE, FFO CAN FACILITATE COMPARISONS OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS AND BETWEEN OTHER REITS. OMEGA OFFERS
        THESE MEASURES TO ASSIST THE USERS OF ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ANALYZING ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND NOT AS MEASURES
        OF LIQUIDITY OR CASH FLOW. FFO, ADJUSTED FFO AND FAD ARE NOT MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT
        BE CONSIDERED AS MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY, ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME OR INDICATORS OF ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURE DETERMINED
        IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. INVESTORS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS IN THE COMPANY’S SECURITIES SHOULD NOT RELY ON THIS MEASURE
        AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY GAAP MEASURE, INCLUDING NET INCOME.
ADJUSTED FFO IS CALCULATED
        AS FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND CERTAIN REVENUE
        AND EXPENSE ITEMS IDENTIFIED ABOVE. FAD IS CALCULATED AS ADJUSTED FFO LESS NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE AND NON-CASH REVENUE,
        SUCH AS STRAIGHT-LINE RENT. OMEGA BELIEVES THESE MEASURES PROVIDE AN ENHANCED MEASURE OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY’S
        CORE PORTFOLIO AS A REIT. OMEGA’S COMPUTATION OF ADJUSTED FFO AND FAD ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE NAREIT DEFINITION OF FFO OR
        TO SIMILAR MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER REITS BUT OMEGA BELIEVES THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE MEASURES FOR OMEGA.

AT A MEETING HELD ON MARCH 16, 2015, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE COMMITTEE) OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES (THE BOARD) OF LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST (THE COMPANY) APPROVED THE LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST 2015 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2015 PLAN), WITH THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. THE 2015 PLAN, DESCRIBED BELOW IN MORE DETAIL, IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR IN DESIGN TO THE LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST 2014 THROUGH 2008 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS, IN THAT IT PROVIDES FOR AN ANNUAL AGGREGATE AWARD (EACH, AN AWARD) COMPOSED OF (I) A GRANT OF PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THE TOTAL TARGETED EXPECTED VALUE OF THE AWARD), AND (II) A GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS (APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE TOTAL TARGETED EXPECTED VALUE OF THE AWARD).  WHEN THE COMPANYS COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST, $0.001 PAR VALUE (THE COMMON SHARES), ARE ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO THE AWARDS THEY UNDERLIE, THEY WILL BE ISSUED UNDER THE COMPANYS AMENDED AND RESTATED SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN (THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN), AND SHALL GENERALLY BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THAT PLAN.
 
2015 PLAN
 
AWARDS UNDER THE 2015 PLAN WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING GENERAL FEATURES:
 
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. A RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT (RSU) UNDER THE 2015 PLAN CONSISTS OF A LEGALLY-BINDING PROMISE TO PAY THE EXECUTIVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE COMMON SHARES AT THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD (AS DEFINED BELOW), TO THE EXTENT CERTAIN ANNUAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE MET OR EXCEEDED.
 
THE RSUS SHALL BE ELIGIBLE TO BE EARNED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD (THE AWARD PERIOD), AND SHALL BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO (I) A PORTION EARNED RATABLY OVER THE AWARD PERIOD ON A YEAR-BY-YEAR BASIS (EACH YEAR CONSTITUTING A RELATED PERFORMANCE PERIOD), USING A SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASURE (THE FIRST PORTION), AND (II) A PORTION EARNED OVER THE FULL AWARD PERIOD, USING ANOTHER SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASURE (THE SECOND PORTION). NEITHER PORTION, HOWEVER, WOULD BE PAYABLE UNTIL THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR AWARD PERIOD. ANY DIVIDENDS THAT ACCUMULATE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD WILL BE PAID IF AND WHEN THE RELATED RSUS ARE REDEEMED AND PAID.
 
UNDER THE 2015 PLAN, THE COMMITTEE HAS THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE A WIDE VARIETY OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES ON WHICH TO BASE EACH PARTICULAR YEARS GRANT OF RSUS, AND WILL ACT EACH YEAR TO DESIGNATE THE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THAT YEAR. FOR THE AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE 2015 PLAN, AS DISCUSSED MORE SPECIFICALLY BELOW, THESE TWO MEASURES ARE BASED, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AS ADJUSTED IF APPROPRIATE) (THE FFO PORTION) FOR THE FIRST PORTION OF THE AWARD, AND ITS TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (THE TSR PORTION) AS COMPARED TO A RELEVANT PEER GROUP FOR THE SECOND PORTION OF THE AWARD. THE COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED A PERFORMANCE METRICS SCHEDULE FOR THE AWARDS TO BE GRANTED UNDER THE 2015 PLAN, LISTING THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH THE ACTUAL FFO PORTION AND TSR PORTION WILL ACCRUE, IN RELATION TO THE SPECIFIED TARGET LEVELS. THESE LEVELS PROVIDE FOR SPECIFIED AWARDS UPON ATTAINMENT OF
 
1





 
STIPULATED PERCENTAGES OF THE TARGET LEVEL (AND INCLUDE A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES PAYABLE OF 200% (272% FOR OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER) OF BOTH THE FIRST PORTION AND THE SECOND PORTION), WITH THE COMMITTEE RETAINING DISCRETION TO REDUCE THE AWARD FROM THE PRESCRIBED LEVEL AS IT DEEMS FIT.
 
THE RSUS THAT COMPRISE THE FIRST PORTION WILL BE SPLIT INTO THREE EQUAL PIECES, CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE RELEVANT AWARD PERIOD. DEPENDING ON HOW EACH YEARS PERFORMANCE COMPARES TO TARGET PERFORMANCE FOR THAT YEAR USING AN ANNUALLY-DETERMINED PERFORMANCE SCHEDULE, A PORTION OF THE RELATED RSUS WILL BE DEEMED EARNED FOR THAT YEAR, AND WILL BE PAYABLE TO THE PARTICIPANT IN COMMON SHARES (UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN) AT THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD. THE RSUS THAT COMPRISE THE SECOND PORTION ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE EARNED ON THE BASIS OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN FOR THE RELEVANT AWARD PERIOD, USING A PERFORMANCE SCHEDULE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD. THE SECOND PORTION WILL BE DEEMED EARNED AND PAYABLE TO THE PARTICIPANT IN COMMON SHARES (UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN) AT THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD.
 
IF A RECIPIENT OF AN AWARD QUITS OR IS DISCHARGED FOR CAUSE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD, ALL RSUS WILL BE FORFEITED, EVEN IF THEY HAVE (IN THE CASE OF THE FIRST PORTION THAT ACCRUES ON A YEAR-BY-YEAR BASIS) ALREADY BEEN EARNED. IF THE RECIPIENT OF AN AWARD IS, INSTEAD, TERMINATED WITHOUT CAUSE, OR TERMINATES BY REASON OF DEATH, DISABILITY OR RETIREMENT (AS DEFINED IN THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN) PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD, THE TREATMENT OF THE RSUS SHALL BE AS SET FORTH IN THE GRANT DOCUMENTS. THE 2015 PLAN ALSO INCLUDES SEVERAL COMMON CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUBJECT TO THE COMMITTEES DISCRETION, THAT WOULD TRIGGER FORFEITURE OF AN AWARD.
 
OPTIONS.  STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE 2015 PLAN WILL BE VESTED (AND THUS EXERCISABLE) SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF TIME AND CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT, WITH NO REGARD TO ANY PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AT A RATE OF 20% OF THE TOTAL OPTION COMPONENT AT THE END OF THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF GRANT, 30% ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY, AND THE REMAINDER ON THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY. IN ADDITION, THEY WILL BECOME IMMEDIATELY VESTED AND EXERCISABLE IN FULL IF THE OPTIONEE CEASES TO BE EMPLOYED BY, OR PROVIDE SERVICES TO, THE TRUST BY REASON OF DEATH OR DISABILITY OR, SUBJECT TO A SLIDING SCALE, RETIREMENT.  THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE, GENERALLY, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT CURRENTLY GOVERN OPTIONS GRANTED TO NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS PART OF THE COMPANYS LTI PROGRAM, AND THUS DO NOT REPRESENT A CHANGE IN THAT COMPONENT OF THE LTI PROGRAM.
 
ON MARCH 16, 2015, THE COMMITTEE MADE AWARDS UNDER THE 2015 PLAN, SUCH AWARDS TO BE GRANTED AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MARCH 16, 2015.  THE AWARDS CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING:

LED BY ITS COMPENSATION AND HUMAN CAPITAL COMMITTEE (THE ""COMMITTEE""), THE REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE OLD AGREEMENTS RESULTED IN THE COMMITTEE'S IDENTIFICATION OF SEVERAL PROVISIONS IN THE OLD AGREEMENTS AS NOT REFLECTING WHAT IT UNDERSTANDS TO BE BEST PRACTICES.  AMONG THESE WAS AN AUTOMATIC ""EVERGREEN"" TERM PROVISION THAT RESULTED IN THE OLD AGREEMENT'S PERPETUAL DURATION.  THE OLD AGREEMENTS ALSO PROVIDED NO MECHANISM FOR THE COMPANY'S NONRENEWAL OF THEM WITHOUT TRIGGERING A SUBSTANTIAL SEVERANCE PAYMENT OBLIGATION.  TOGETHER THESE PROVISIONS GAVE EXECUTIVES CONSIDERABLE LEVERAGE TO RESIST CHANGES IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT.  IN THIS REGARD, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN CONSIDERATION OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AGREEING TO RETIRE, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO PAY RETIREMENT SEVERANCE BENEFITS SUBSTANTIALLY EQUAL TO THOSE THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE TO HIM UNDER HIS OLD AGREEMENT IF HE WERE TO BE TERMINATED WITHOUT ""CAUSE.""AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE COMMITTEE'S REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE OLD AGREEMENTS, THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMPANY'S NEW PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GREGORY K. SILVERS, WORKED TOGETHER IN DEVELOPING A NEW FORM OF EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (THE ""NEW AGREEMENTS"").  THE NEW AGREEMENTS WERE DESIGNED WITH THE INTENT OF BEING MORE CONSISTENT WITH BEST PRACTICES AND PROVIDING THE COMPANY WITH GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN ITS DECISION MAKING AS TO ITS EXECUTIVES AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT.  DESPITE THE PERCEIVED ECONOMIC INCENTIVE THAT MOST OF THE EXECUTIVES PERSONALLY HAD TO RETAIN THE OLD AGREEMENTS, THE EXECUTIVES NEVERTHELESS AGREED TO REPLACE THE OLD AGREEMENTS WITH THE NEW AGREEMENTS.  ON MAY 13, 2015, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO THE NEW AGREEMENTS WITH EACH OF ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, NAMELY THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS:GREGORY K. SILVERS, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERMARK A. PETERSON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERMORGAN G. EARNEST II, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICERCRAIG L. EVANS, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, GENERAL COUNSEL AND SECRETARYTHOMAS B. WRIGHT, III, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT - HUMAN RESOURCES AND ADMINISTRATIONMICHAEL L. HIRONS, VICE PRESIDENT - STRATEGIC PLANNINGONE OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES REFLECTED IN THE NEW AGREEMENTS AS COMPARED TO THE OLD AGREEMENTS IS THE REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF THE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AVAILABLE TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS UPON A TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT ""CAUSE"" OR WITH ""GOOD REASON,"" A TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO DISABILITY OR DEATH.  UNDER THE OLD AGREEMENTS WITH MESSRS. SILVERS, PETERSON, EARNEST AND HIRONS (MESSRS. EVANS AND WRIGHT RECENTLY JOINED THE COMPANY AND WERE NOT PARTIES TO THE OLD AGREEMENTS), IF THE EMPLOYMENT OF EACH OF THOSE EXECUTIVES HAD BEEN TERMINATED THIS YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY SUCH EVENT, THE AGGREGATE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUAL TO APPROXIMATELY $23.1 MILLION.  IN CONTRAST, THE AGGREGATE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $6.3 MILLION (A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $16.8 MILLION) UNDER THE NEW AGREEMENTS.  THIS REDUCTION IN POTENTIAL SEVERANCE PAYMENTS RESULTED FROM A REDUCTION IN THE SEVERANCE MULTIPLE APPLICABLE TO MOST EXECUTIVES AND THE ELIMINATION OF LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (""LTIP"") AWARDS FROM THE SEVERANCE PAYMENT CALCULATION.THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES THE MATERIAL CHANGES IMPLEMENTED BY THE NEW AGREEMENTS AS COMPARED TO THE OLD AGREEMENTS:PROVISIONOLD AGREEMENTSNEW AGREEMENTSTERMPERPETUAL, AUTOMATIC EVERGREEN, TERM.

THE PLAN WILL APPLY TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS UPON EXPIRATION OF THEIR NEW AGREEMENTS IN THREE YEARS.  AT THAT TIME, THE SEVERANCE PAYMENT CALCULATION FOR ALL EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WILL BE BASED ON A 2X SEVERANCE MULTIPLE TIMES THE SUM OF BASE SALARY PLUS THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUS, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL, IN WHICH CASE MR. SILVERS WILL BE ENTITLED TO A 3X SEVERANCE MULTIPLE AND MR. PETERSON WILL BE ENTITLED TO A 2.5X SEVERANCE MULTIPLE.

ALTHOUGH MR. BARRY PORTNOY WAS ELECTED AS A MANAGING TRUSTEE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANYS GOVERNING DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE LAW BY A PLURALITY OF THE VOTES CAST, HIS ELECTION DID NOT RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE SHARE VOTES CAST.  PURSUANT TO THE COMPANYS GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES, MR. PORTNOY PRESENTED HIS RESIGNATION AS A MANAGING TRUSTEE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMPANYS NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE, OR THE COMMITTEE, AND THE COMPANYS BOARD.  THE COMMITTEE (COMPOSED ONLY OF INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES) AND THE BOARD (WITHOUT MESSRS. BARRY PORTNOY OR ADAM PORTNOY PARTICIPATING), ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMITTEE, EACH UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED NOT TO ACCEPT MR. BARRY PORTNOYS RESIGNATION FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS, AMONG OTHERS:
 
·                  IT APPEARS THAT THE WITHHOLD VOTE AGAINST MR. PORTNOYS ELECTION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MOTIVATED BY THE RECOMMENDATION OF INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES INC., OR ISS.  THE STATED REASON FOR ISSS RECOMMENDATION IS THAT MR. PORTNOY IS OVERBOARDED BECAUSE HE SERVES ON BOARDS OF MORE THAN SIX PUBLICLY OWNED COMPANIES.   ALL OF THE COMPANIES ON WHOSE BOARDS MR. PORTNOY SERVES ARE MANAGED BY REIT MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH LLC AND ITS AFFILIATES, OR RMR.  MR. PORTNOY IS CHAIRMAN AND A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE OF RMR.  THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD KNOW THAT MR. PORTNOY HAS AN ALMOST 100% ATTENDANCE RECORD AT BOARD MEETINGS AND THAT HE HAS DEMONSTRATED AT SUCH MEETINGS THAT HE IS FULLY ENGAGED AND FAMILIAR WITH THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.  THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD ARE CONFIDENT THAT MR. PORTNOY HAS THE TIME AND CAPACITY TO DEVOTE TO BOARD BUSINESS.
 
·                  THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD BELIEVE MR. PORTNOYS CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN BOARD DECISION MAKING IS INVALUABLE TO THE BOARD AND IN THE COMPANYS INTEREST.  MR. PORTNOY HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY AND PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE RELATED TO HEALTHCARE RELATED REAL ESTATE.  IN ADDITION TO HIS CURRENT BOARD SERVICE, MR. PORTNOY PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS A DIRECTOR OF TWO NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LISTED PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SERVICE COMPANIES.  BEFORE HE BECAME A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE OF RMR, MR. PORTNOY WAS A PRACTICING BUSINESS LAWYER AND CHAIRMAN OF A LAW FIRM WITH OFFICES IN BOSTON, NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON, D.C.   AS A BUSINESSMAN AND A LAWYER, MR. PORTNOY HAS STRUCTURED AND NEGOTIATED MANY LARGE, COMPLEX REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING HEALTHCARE RELATED REAL ESTATE.
 
·                  THE COMPANYS GOVERNING DOCUMENTS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY HAVE AT LEAST TWO MANAGING TRUSTEES WHO ARE INVOLVED WITH THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON A DAILY BASIS, IN ADDITION TO HAVING A MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.  MR. PORTNOYS INVOLVEMENT IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ON A DAILY BASIS PROVIDES BENEFITS TO THE BOARD THAT COMPLEMENT THE PERSPECTIVES PROVIDED BY THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.  THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD DETERMINED THAT MR. PORTNOY IS A PERSON ESPECIALLY QUALIFIED TO SERVE AS MANAGING TRUSTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD.
 
2





 
AFTER INQUIRIES FROM THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD, MR. PORTNOY CONFIRMED THAT HE IS WILLING TO CONTINUE TO SERVE ON THE BOARD.  SINCE HIS RESIGNATION WAS NOT ACCEPTED, MR. PORTNOY WILL CONTINUE AS A MANAGING TRUSTEE UNTIL THE 2016 ANNUAL MEETING OR UNTIL HIS SUCCESSOR IS DULY QUALIFIED, ELECTED OR APPOINTED.

ON JUNE 5, 2015, PURSUANT TO A TRANSACTION AGREEMENT BY AND AMONG US, OUR MANAGER, RMR LLC, ITS THEN SOLE MEMBER, RMR TRUST, AND RMR INC, A NEW HOLDING COMPANY OF RMR LLC, WE ACQUIRED 5,272,787 SHARES OF RMR INCS CLASS A COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE, OR INC SHARES, FROM RMR INC FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $60,739,080.

THROUGH OUR AND THE OTHER REITS ACQUISITION OF INC SHARES, WE AND THE OTHER REITS INDIRECTLY ACQUIRED COMBINED ECONOMIC OWNERSHIP OF 48.4% OF RMR LLC.  WE AND THE OTHER REITS ARE EACH MANAGED BY RMR LLC.  PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS WITH THE OTHER REITS, WE AND THE OTHER REITS EACH AGREED TO DISTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE INC SHARES WE AND THEY ACQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION TO OUR AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SHAREHOLDERS AS A SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION, AND RMR INC AGREED TO FACILITATE THIS DISTRIBUTION BY FILING A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OR SEC, TO REGISTER THE INC SHARES TO BE DISTRIBUTED AND BY SEEKING A LISTING OF THOSE SHARES ON A NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE

UPON THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT BEING DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO DISTRIBUTE THE INC SHARES TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS BEFORE YEAR END 2015.
 
OUR AND THE OTHER REITS ACQUISITION OF INC SHARES WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF AN UP-C TRANSACTION STRUCTURE IN WHICH OUR COMMON SHARES, TOGETHER WITH COMMON SHARES OF THE OTHER REITS AND CASH IN THE AMOUNTS PAID TO RMR INC, WERE PAID BY RMR INC TO RMR TRUST TO ACQUIRE ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN RMR LLC.  IN THE UP-C TRANSACTION, RMR TRUST RECEIVED SHARES OF RMR INCS CLASS B-2 COMMON STOCK, WHICH HAVE 10:1 VOTING RIGHTS AND NO ECONOMIC INTEREST, AND ARE PAIRED WITH RMR TRUSTS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN RMR LLC.  ADDITIONALLY, RMR TRUST ACQUIRED SHARES OF RMR INCS CLASS B-1 COMMON STOCK FOR CASH AT THE SAME PER SHARE PRICE THAT WE PAID FOR THE INC SHARES WE ACQUIRED.  THE CLASS B-1 SHARES HAVE 10:1 VOTING RIGHTS, BUT OTHERWISE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS THE CLASS A COMMON STOCK.  IN THE AGGREGATE, RMR TRUST OWNS, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, 51.6% OF RMR LLC, AND RMR TRUST OWNS 91.4% OF THE VOTING RIGHTS IN RMR INC.  AS A RESULT, SO LONG AS RMR TRUST DOES NOT CONVERT ITS OWNERSHIP IN RMR LLC INTO COMMON SHARES OF RMR INC, OR SELL THE SHARES OF RMR INC IT RECEIVED IN THE TRANSACTION TO UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES, RMR TRUST, WHICH IS BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY MR. BARRY PORTNOY AND MR. ADAM PORTNOY, WILL CONTROL RMR INC AND WILL CONTINUE TO CONTROL RMR LLC.
 
OUR COMMON SHARES THAT WE ISSUED TO RMR INC AND THE INC SHARES THAT WE ACQUIRED ARE UNREGISTERED.  CONCURRENTLY WITH ENTERING INTO THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT, WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A REGISTRATION RIGHTS AND LOCK-UP AGREEMENT BY AND AMONG US, RMR TRUST, MR. BARRY PORTNOY AND MR. ADAM PORTNOY WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMON SHARES, PURSUANT TO WHICH RMR TRUST, MR. BARRY PORTNOY AND MR. ADAM PORTNOY EACH AGREED NOT TO TRANSFER OUR COMMON SHARES ACQUIRED BY RMR TRUST FROM RMR INC FOR A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND RECEIVED DEMAND AND PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS.  WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT WITH RMR INC WITH RESPECT TO THE INC SHARES THAT WE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE RECEIVED DEMAND AND PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS.
 
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS THEREOF WERE NEGOTIATED AND REVIEWED BY A JOINT SPECIAL COMMITTEE COMPRISED SOLELY OF OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES AND THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES OF THE OTHER REITS, OR THE JOINT SPECIAL COMMITTEE, AND WERE SEPARATELY APPROVED AND ADOPTED BY OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE WHO DOES NOT SERVE AS AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE OF ANY OF THE OTHER REITS, OR OUR DISINTERESTED TRUSTEE, BY A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES, COMPRISED SOLELY OF OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, OR OUR SPECIAL COMMITTEE, AND BY OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES.  MORGAN STANLEY & CO. LLC ACTED AS FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO THE JOINT SPECIAL COMMITTEE AND CENTERVIEW PARTNERS LLC ACTED AS FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO OUR SPECIAL COMMITTEE.

THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K REFERS TO AN ANTICIPATED DISTRIBUTION OF INC SHARES WE AND THE OTHER REITS HAVE AGREED TO MAKE TO OUR AND THE OTHER REITS SHAREHOLDERS.  THIS DISTRIBUTION WILL BE MADE ONLY AFTER A REGISTRATION STATEMENT, INCLUDING A PROSPECTUS, IS FILED BY RMR INC AND DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC.  THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL OR SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY SHARES OF RMR INC, US OR ANY OTHER REIT.

LLC ACTED AS FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO THE JOINT SPECIAL COMMITTEE; AND THAT CENTERVIEW PARTNERS LLC ACTED AS FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO OUR SPECIAL COMMITTEE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
ITEM 9.01 OF THIS CURRENT REPORT PROVIDES CERTAIN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES AND 18 OF THE SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES, AS WELL AS UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECTING (1) THE ACQUISITION OF THE HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES, (2) THE ACQUISITION OF 37 OF 38 SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES, (3) FINANCING ACTIVITY RELATED TO THESE ACQUISITIONS, (4) THE OTHER COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN OTHER ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, AND (5) THE PENDING ACQUISITION OF THE REMAINING ONE SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITY DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER 38 SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES.
 
THIS HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE EXPECTED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF SNH FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD. DIFFERENCES COULD RESULT FROM MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE CHANGES IN SNHS INVESTMENTS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CHANGES IN OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE.
 
NEITHER SNH NOR ITS AFFILIATES ARE RELATED TO CCIT OR TO THE SELLER OF THE SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES. THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN ITEM 9.01(A) PRESENT THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES AND 18 OF THE SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES DURING PERIODS PRIOR TO THEIR ACQUISITION BY SNH AND EXCLUDE, AS PERMITTED BY RULE 3-14 OF REGULATION S-X, ITEMS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE WHICH SNH EXPECTS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATION BY THE COMPANY. IN ASSESSING THE HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES AND THESE 18 SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES, SNH CONSIDERED EACH PROPERTYS REVENUE SOURCES, INCLUDING THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN AFFECTED, AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE, BY FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DEMAND, SUPPLY AND COMPETITIVE FACTORS PRESENT IN THE LOCAL AND NATIONAL MARKETS FOR SINGLE TENANT, NET LEASED PROPERTIES AND SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES AND THE ABILITY OF TENANTS TO MAKE PAYMENTS WHEN DUE. WE ALSO CONSIDERED THE PROPERTIES EXPENSES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, UTILITY COSTS, TAX RATES AND OTHER EXPENSES, AND THE PORTION OF SUCH EXPENSES WHICH MAY BE RECOVERED FROM TENANTS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS OR OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED IN THE NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA DATA PROVIDED BELOW WILL CAUSE FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THE HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA OPERATING RESULTS PRESENTED, BUT CANNOT BE PREDICTED AT THIS TIME; HOWEVER, AFTER REASONABLE INQUIRY, WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY OTHER MATERIAL FACTORS RELATING TO THE PROPERTIES THAT WOULD CAUSE THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION REPORTED HEREIN NOT TO BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

UPREIT STRUCTURE; SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP 
 
ON APRIL 1, 2015, AVIV REIT INC., A MARYLAND CORPORATION (“AVIV”),
MERGED (THE “MERGER”) WITH AND INTO A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF OMEGA HEALTHCARE INVESTORS, INC., A MARYLAND
CORPORATION (THE “COMPANY” OR “OMEGA”), PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THAT CERTAIN AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER, DATED AS OF OCTOBER 30, 2014 (THE “MERGER AGREEMENT”), BY AND AMONG THE COMPANY, AVIV, OHI HEALTHCARE
PROPERTIES HOLDCO, INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION AND A DIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF OMEGA (“MERGER SUB”),
OHI HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, A DELAWARE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (“OMEGA OP”), AND AVIV HEALTHCARE
PROPERTIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, A DELAWARE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (THE “AVIV OP”).
 
SHORTLY PRIOR TO APRIL 1, 2015 AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, OMEGA RESTRUCTURED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT HOLDS ITS ASSETS BY CONVERTING TO AN UMBRELLA PARTNERSHIP REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT
TRUST (“UPREIT”) STRUCTURE (THE “UPREIT CONVERSION”), WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A SERIES
OF SUBSIDIARY MERGERS AND BY CAUSING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE OTHER ASSETS OF THE COMPANY (OTHER THAN OMEGA’S DIRECT AND
INDIRECT EQUITY INTERESTS IN MERGER SUB AND THE OMEGA OP) TO BE CONTRIBUTED TO OMEGA OP.
 
PRIOR TO THE MERGER, ON APRIL 1, 2015 AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
MERGER AGREEMENT, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF AVIV OP WERE CONTRIBUTED TO AND ACQUIRED BY OMEGA OP, WHEREBY ALL SUCH ASSETS
ARE NOW OWNED OR HELD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH OMEGA OP, AN ENTITY TAXABLE AS A PARTNERSHIP FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES
(THE “PARTNERSHIP COMBINATION”).
 

IN ORDER TO MORE FULLY REFLECT THE UPREIT CONVERSION AND TO
EFFECT THE PARTNERSHIP COMBINATION, OMEGA, MERGER SUB AND AVIV OP ENTERED INTO THAT CERTAIN SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED
AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF OHI HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, DATED AS OF APRIL 1, 2015 (THE
“PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT”). PURSUANT TO THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB ARE THE

THE TERMS OF ITS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY IS THE OWNER OF APPROXIMATELY 138.9 MILLION LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IN OMEGA OP (“OMEGA OP UNITS”) AND AVIV OP IS THE OWNER OF APPROXIMATELY 52.9
MILLION OMEGA OP UNITS. EACH OF THE OMEGA OP UNITS IS REDEEMABLE AT THE ELECTION OF THE OMEGA OP UNIT HOLDER FOR CASH EQUAL
TO THE THEN FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ONE SHARE OF OMEGA COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.10 PER SHARE (“OMEGA COMMON
STOCK”), SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY’S ELECTION TO EXCHANGE THE OMEGA OP UNITS TENDERED FOR REDEMPTION FOR
UNREGISTERED SHARES OF OMEGA COMMON STOCK ON A ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS, AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT AS SET FORTH IN THE
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY (THROUGH MERGER SUB, IN ITS CAPACITY AS THE GENERAL PARTNER OF AVIV OP) PLANS TO CAUSE
AVIV OP TO MAKE A DISTRIBUTION OF ALL THE OMEGA OP UNITS HELD BY AVIV OP (OR EQUIVALENT VALUE) TO ALL THE HOLDERS
OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF AVIV OP (THE “AVIV OP DISTRIBUTION”). ON A PRO FORMA BASIS AS IF THE AVIV OP
DISTRIBUTION HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND THE OMEGA OP UNITS HELD BY THE AVIV OP DISTRIBUTED TO THE HOLDERS OF AVIV OP PARTNERSHIP
INTERESTS, OMEGA WOULD DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY OWN APPROXIMATELY 182.6 MILLION OR APPROXIMATELY 95% OF THE OUTSTANDING OMEGA
OP UNITS AND THE OTHER HOLDERS OF AVIV OP PARTNERSHIP UNITS WOULD OWN APPROXIMATELY 9.2 MILLION OR APPROXIMATELY 5% OF THE
OUTSTANDING OMEGA OP UNITS AS OF APRIL 1, 2015. UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF THE AVIV OP DISTRIBUTION, DISTRIBUTIONS BY OMEGA OP
IN RESPECT OF THE OUTSTANDING OMEGA OP UNITS WILL BE PASSED THROUGH TO THE LIMITED PARTNERS OF AVIV OP IN RESPECT OF THEIR
LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS IN AVIV OP ADJUSTED FOR THE EXCHANGE RATIO (AS DEFINED BELOW).

THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES FOR LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
UNITS STRUCTURED AS PROFITS INTERESTS (“LTIP UNITS”), WHICH ARE TO BE USED FOR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS.
SEE ITEM 5.02 BELOW. WHEN EARNED AND VESTED, LTIP UNITS ARE INTENDED TO BE CONVERTIBLE INTO OMEGA OP UNITS, AT THE ELECTION
OF THE HOLDER, ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS, SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS ON MINIMUM ALLOCATION TO THE CAPITAL ACCOUNTS OF THE HOLDERS OF LTIP
UNITS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
 
OVERVIEW
 
ON MARCH 30, 2015, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE APPROVED
THE FORMS OF AGREEMENTS THAT WILL EVIDENCE THE GRANT TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS, EFFECTIVE
MARCH 31, 2015 (APRIL 1, 2015 WITH RESPECT TO STEVEN INSOFT) AND SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE IF THE MERGER DID NOT OCCUR. THE MATERIAL
TERMS (OTHER THAN AMOUNTS) OF THE 2015 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS ARE SIMILAR TO THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED
EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014. HOWEVER, THE 2015 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INCLUDE,
AS PART OF THE AWARDS, LTIP UNITS OF THE OMEGA OP, WHICH ARE EARNED BASED ON OMEGA’S TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (“TSR”)
PERFORMANCE. LTIP UNITS THAT BECOME EARNED AND VESTED ARE CONVERTIBLE ON ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS INTO OP UNITS, WHICH IN TURN CAN GENERALLY
BE REDEEMED FOR CASH OR OMEGA COMMON STOCK AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1.01 ABOVE.
 
THE SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
GRANTS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW. THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENT BELOW ASSUME THAT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAS NOT ELECTED
TO DEFER RECEIPT OF THE OMEGA COMMON STOCK OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS UNDER OMEGA’S DEFERRED STOCK PLAN.
 

11
 

 
DESCRIPTION OF GRANTS
 
EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S GRANT, EFFECTIVE MARCH
31, 2015 (OR APRIL 1, 2015 FOR STEVEN INSOFT), INCLUDED TIME-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (“RSUS”), PERFORMANCE-BASED
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WITH RESPECT TO OMEGA’S COMMON STOCK (“PRSUS”) AND PERFORMANCE-BASED LTIP UNITS.
THE RSUS AND PRSUS PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF OMEGA OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD COMMENCING
JANUARY 1, 2015. THE LTIP UNITS PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A NUMBER OF LTIP UNITS IN OMEGA’S OP OVER THE SAME THREE YEAR
PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDES EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITH THE ABILITY TO EARN A NUMBER OF SHARES OF OMEGA COMMON STOCK
AND A NUMBER OF LTIP UNITS THAT TOGETHER WOULD PRODUCE THE PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE (INCLUDING DIVIDENDS AND
DISTRIBUTIONS) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE THRESHOLD, TARGET AND HIGH LEVELS OF LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
ARE BASED IN PART ON ABSOLUTE TSR PERFORMANCE AND RELATIVE TSR PERFORMANCE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD AS COMPARED TO THE MSCI U.S.
REIT INDEX. THE METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THESE AMOUNTS WAS AS FOLLOWS. FPL ESTIMATED MEDIAN TOTAL ANNUAL COMPENSATION, USING
GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE DATA, FOR THE TOP FIVE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AT THE COMPANIES IN OMEGA’S PEER GROUP USED FOR BENCHMARKING.
TARGET MEDIAN TOTAL ANNUAL COMPENSATION FOR THE TOP FIVE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF OMEGA ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS WAS DESIGNED TO BE GENERALLY
IN LINE WITH THE MEDIAN FOR THE PEER GROUP. THE AGGREGATE COMPENSATION AT THE THRESHOLD, TARGET AND HIGH PERFORMANCE LEVELS, BASED
ON GRANT DATE FAIR VALUES, WAS THEN CONVERTED INTO PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE USING A CONVERSION FACTOR INTENDED
TO REPLICATE OMEGA’S ESTIMATED RATIO OF GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF 2014 COMPENSATION FOR THE TOP FIVE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AT
EACH PERFORMANCE LEVEL TO THE PROJECTED ESTIMATED ECONOMIC VALUE OF 2014 COMPENSATION FOR THE TOP FIVE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AT EACH
PERFORMANCE LEVEL. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT WAS THEN ALLOCATED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IN A MANNER THAT GENERALLY PRESERVED INTERNAL
PAY EQUITY WHILE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS THAT THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINED TO BE APPROPRIATE AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT STEVEN
INSOFT WOULD BE ONE OF THE TOP FIVE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOR 2015 SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

*REPRESENTS PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE REALIZABLE BY THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE AMOUNTS
OF THE 2015 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION GRANTS ARE BASED ON PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE POTENTIALLY REALIZABLE
BY EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RATHER THAN THE ESTIMATED COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO BE RECOGNIZED BY OMEGA UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING
PRINCIPLES (“GAAP”). OMEGA EXPECTS THAT THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANNUAL GRANTS UNDER GAAP
WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE REALIZABLE BY
 

12
 

 
THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC
VALUE REFLECTS THE AMOUNT AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE AND INCLUDES PROJECTED DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.
 

·TIME-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS. EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S 2015 ANNUAL LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
AWARD CONSISTS IN PART OF A TIME-BASED RSU AWARD. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OMEGA COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THE RSU AWARD IS PROJECTED
TO PRODUCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, ONE-HALF OF THE PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE AT TARGET IN TABLE 1.

THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO THE TIME-BASED RSUS GRANTED AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 (APRIL 1, 2015 AS TO STEVEN INSOFT) ARE SHOWN

OF DEATH, DISABILITY, TERMINATION BY OMEGA WITHOUT CAUSE (AS DEFINED IN THE RSU AWARD), OR RESIGNATION FOR GOOD REASON (AS DEFINED
IN THE RSU AWARD) (EACH, A “QUALIFYING TERMINATION”). IF THE QUALIFYING TERMINATION IS NOT IN CONNECTION WITH

WILL BE PAID CURRENTLY ON UNVESTED AND VESTED UNITS. THE NUMBER OF VESTED RSUS WILL BE PAID IN OMEGA COMMON STOCK UPON VESTING.
 

·PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS. ADDITIONALLY, EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S 2015 ANNUAL LONG-TERM INCENTIVE
COMPENSATION CONSISTS IN PART OF AN AWARD OF PRSUS. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OMEGA COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO PRSUS AT EACH PERFORMANCE
LEVEL (THRESHOLD, TARGET AND HIGH) IS PROJECTED TO PRODUCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE
SHOWN IN TABLE 1 ABOVE, LESS THE PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RSUS AND LTIP UNITS. THEREFORE,
 

13
 

 
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED UNDER THE PRSUS, IF
TARGET PERFORMANCE IS ACHIEVED, WILL BE EQUAL TO ONE-HALF THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO THE TIME-BASED RSUS. SIMILARLY, THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED UNDER THE PRSUS IF THRESHOLD PERFORMANCE IS ACHIEVED WILL BE LESS, AND IF HIGH PERFORMANCE IS ACHIEVED
WILL BE MORE, THAN ONE-HALF THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO THE RSUS.
 
THE LEVEL OF PRSUS THAT WILL BE EARNED WILL BE BASED ON
THE LEVEL OF TSR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE MSCI U.S. REIT INDEX (“RELATIVE TSR”) ACHIEVED OVER THE THREE YEAR
PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2017, AS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW:

PER SHARE OF OMEGA COMMON STOCK FOR NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2014.
 
THE PRSU AWARDS GRANTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
EFFECTIVE AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 (APRIL 1, 2015 AS TO STEVEN INSOFT) ALLOW THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TO EARN A NUMBER OF SHARES SHOWN

THE NUMBER OF SHARES EARNED UNDER THE PRSUS WILL BE DETERMINED
AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD NORMALLY ENDS AT DECEMBER 31, 2017. 25% OF THE EARNED PRSUS
WILL VEST ON THE LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER IN 2018, SUBJECT TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT ON THE VESTING
DATE, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A QUALIFYING TERMINATION. IF THE QUALIFYING TERMINATION IS NOT IN CONNECTION WITH A CHANGE IN CONTROL,
VESTING WILL BE PRORATED BASED ON DAYS ELAPSED IN THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD THROUGH THE DATE OF THE QUALIFYING TERMINATION OR WILL
BE ACCELERATED 100% IF THE QUALIFYING TERMINATION OCCURS ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017. IF A CHANGE IN CONTROL OCCURS DURING THE
THREE YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD WILL END ON THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. IF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS
EMPLOYED ON THE DATE OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL OR HAS A QUALIFYING TERMINATION IN CONNECTION WITH A CHANGE IN CONTROL, DEPENDING ON
THE LEVEL OF RELATIVE TSR AS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL, ALL, A PORTION, OR NONE OF THE PRSUS WILL BE EARNED AND VESTED
ON THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.

THE EARNED AND VESTED PRSUS WILL BE PAID IN OMEGA COMMON
STOCK WITHIN TEN DAYS FOLLOWING VESTING OR ON THE DATE OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL, IF EARLIER.
 
DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAYABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD
AFTER JANUARY 1, 2015 ACCRUE ON PRSUS THAT ARE SUBSEQUENTLY EARNED AT THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. ACCRUED DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS
WILL BE PAID TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITHIN TEN DAYS FOLLOWING THE LAST DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS
EARNED THEREAFTER ON THE EARNED AND UNVESTED PRSUS ARE PAID CURRENTLY.
 

·LTIP UNITS. THE REMAINDER OF EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S 2015 ANNUAL LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONSISTS OF
AN AWARD OF PERFORMANCE-BASED LTIP UNITS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 (OR APRIL 1, 2015 FOR STEVEN INSOFT), EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECEIVED
A NUMBER OF LTIP UNITS PROJECTED TO PRODUCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE SHOWN IN TABLE
1 ABOVE FOR THE HIGH LEVEL, LESS THE PROJECTED ESTIMATED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RSUS AND THE PRSUS AT THE HIGH
LEVEL.
 
A.      EARNING AND VESTING OF LTIP UNITS
 
THE NUMBER OF LTIP UNITS EARNED (“EARNED LTIP
UNITS”) BY EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE LEVEL OF ABSOLUTE TSR ACHIEVED OVER THE THREE YEAR PERFORMANCE
PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2017, BASED ON THE FOLLOWING TABLE:
 


TSR-BASED PRSUS 
THRESHOLD  
TARGET

 10% 
 12%

 
THE BASELINE STOCK PRICE FROM WHICH TSR WILL BE MEASURED
FOR THE PRSUS OVER THE THREE YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2017 IS $38.32, THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE PER SHARE OF
OMEGA COMMON STOCK FOR NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2014.
 
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LTIP UNITS EARNED AT EACH PERFORMANCE
LEVEL (THRESHOLD, TARGET AND HIGH) CORRESPONDS TO THAT NUMBER OF SHARES OF OMEGA COMMON STOCK THAT IS PROJECTED TO PRODUCE AS OF
DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE PROJECTED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE SHOWN IN TABLE 1 ABOVE, LESS THE PROJECTED ACCRUED ECONOMIC VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE
TO THE RSUS AND PRSUS. THEREFORE, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EARNED LTIP UNITS IF TARGET PERFORMANCE IS ACHIEVED WILL BE EQUAL TO ONE-HALF
THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO THE TIME-BASED RSUS. SIMILARLY, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EARNED LTIP UNITS IF THRESHOLD PERFORMANCE
IS ACHIEVED WILL BE LESS, AND IF HIGH PERFORMANCE IS ACHIEVED WILL BE MORE, THAN ONE-HALF THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO THE RSUS.
ALL LTIP UNITS THAT HAVE NOT BECOME EARNED LTIP UNITS AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD ARE FORFEITED AS OF THE LAST
DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD.
 
THE LTIP UNIT AWARDS GRANTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
EFFECTIVE AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 (APRIL 1, 2015 AS TO STEVEN INSOFT) ALLOW THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TO EARN A NUMBER OF LTIP UNITS

BRUCE M. GANS, M.D., AND ADAM D. PORTNOY EACH RECEIVED LESS THAN THE MAJORITY OF SHARE VOTES REQUIRED FOR ELECTION UNDER THE COMPANYS DECLARATION OF TRUST AND EACH RESIGNED FROM THE BOARD AFTER THE PRELIMINARY VOTING RESULTS BECAME KNOWN. FOLLOWING THESE RESIGNATIONS, THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND OF THE BOARD MET AND DETERMINED TO ELECT DR. GANS AS AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE AND MR. PORTNOY AS A MANAGING TRUSTEE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS, AMONG OTHERS:
 
·                  THE COMPANYS BOARD IS COMPOSED OF THREE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES AND TWO MANAGING TRUSTEES. APPLICABLE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULES REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY HAVE AN AUDIT COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF AT LEAST THREE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES. APPLICABLE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING REQUIREMENTS MANDATE THAT THE COMPANY HAVE A MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES AND AN AUDIT COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF AT LEAST THREE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES. THE COMPANYS GOVERNING DOCUMENTS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY HAVE AT LEAST TWO MANAGING TRUSTEES AND A MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES ON THE COMPANYS BOARD. BECAUSE OF THESE RULES, LISTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE COMPANYS GOVERNING DOCUMENTS, THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD DETERMINED TO TAKE PROMPT ACTION TO FILL THE VACANCIES ON THE COMPANYS BOARD.
 
·                  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD CONSIDERED THE QUALITY OF THE PAST SERVICES PROVIDED BY DR. GANS AND MR. PORTNOY AS TRUSTEES. THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD NOTED THAT DR. GANS AND MR. PORTNOY REGULARLY ATTENDED MEETINGS OF THE BOARD AND OF THE APPLICABLE BOARD COMMITTEES, THAT BOTH DR. GANS AND MR. PORTNOY WERE FULLY PREPARED FOR, AND ENGAGED IN, THOSE MEETINGS AND THAT THE ARGUMENTS,
 
2





 
ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS PRESENTED BY DR. GANS AND MR. PORTNOY AT THOSE MEETINGS WERE CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD TO BE IN THE COMPANYS INTEREST.
 
·                  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED THE BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE THAT EACH OF DR. GANS AND MR. PORTNOY BRING TO THE BOARD AND TO THE COMPANY. DR. GANS IS AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND A FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF MAJOR HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS AND AN EXPERIENCED INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR OF PUBLICLY HELD COMPANIES. MR. PORTNOY IS A FORMER INVESTMENT BANKER AND THE CURRENT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMPANYS MANAGER. MR. PORTNOY ALSO SERVES ON THE BOARDS OF OTHER PUBLIC REAL ESTATE COMPANIES. THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD CONCLUDED THAT THE PERSPECTIVES PROVIDED BY DR. GANS AND MR. PORTNOY ARE VERY HELPFUL TO THE BOARD AND TO THE COMPANY.
 
·                  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD ALSO CONSIDERED CERTAIN ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE ELECTION OF DR. GANS AND MR. PORTNOY PRESENTED DURING THE PROXY SOLICITATION PERIOD FOR THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING. THE COMMITTEE NOTED THAT UNITE HERE HAD SOLICITED SHARE VOTES AGAINST THE ELECTIONS OF DR. GANS AND MR. PORTNOY FOR THE STATED REASONS THAT THE BOARD HAD FAILED TO INCLUDE A UNITE HERE PROPOSAL IN THE COMPANYS PROXY STATEMENT AND FAILED TO IMPLEMENT A SIMILAR PROPOSAL VOTED AT THE 2014 ANNUAL MEETING. THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD ALSO CONSIDERED THAT UNITE HERE IS A LABOR UNION WHICH IS ENGAGED IN LABOR ORGANIZING CAMPAIGNS AT CERTAIN HOTELS OWNED BY THE COMPANY AND THAT UNITE HERE PUBLICLY STATED THAT IT EXPECTED TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON ITS PROXY CAMPAIGN THAN THE TOTAL VALUE OF UNITE HERES SHARE OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY. THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD ALSO NOTED THAT INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES, INC., OR ISS, A PROXY ADVISORY BUSINESS, HAD SUPPORTED THE UNITE HERE CAMPAIGN AND HAD ALSO ARGUED THAT MR. PORTNOY SHOULD NOT BE RE-ELECTED BECAUSE HE SERVES ON MORE THAN THREE PUBLIC COMPANY BOARDS WHILE SERVING AS A CEO OF AN OUTSIDE COMPANY. THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD NOTED THAT MR. PORTNOY IS THE CEO AND A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE OF REIT MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH LLC, THE COMPANYS MANAGER AND THE MANAGER OF THE OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES ON WHOSE BOARDS MR. PORTNOY SERVES. THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD NOTED THAT THIS ISS ARGUMENT SEEMED TO APPLY A ONE SIZE FITS ALL RULE WHICH DID NOT APPEAR TO BE APPLICABLE TO MR. PORTNOYS CIRCUMSTANCES. THE BOARD DETERMINED THAT MR. PORTNOY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT HE HAS THE TIME FOR HIS SERVICE ON MULTIPLE BOARDS, THAT HE PROVIDED IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES TO THE BOARDS DELIBERATIONS AND THAT HE WAS QUALIFIED TO SERVE AS A MANAGING TRUSTEE OF THE COMPANY.
 
·                  AFTER CONSIDERING THE FOREGOING, THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD DETERMINED THAT THE HISTORY OF HIGH QUALITY SERVICES PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED BY DR. GANS AND MR. PORTNOY OUTWEIGHED THE ARGUMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENTED AGAINST THEIR ELECTIONS AND THAT IT IS IN THE COMPANYS BEST INTEREST THAT EACH CONTINUE AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD.
 
IN RESPONSE TO INQUIRIES FROM THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD, DR. GANS AND MR. PORTNOY EACH AGREED TO CONTINUE TO SERVE AS A TRUSTEE IF RE-APPOINTED, AND THE COMMITTEE THEN RECOMMENDED AND THE BOARD THEN ELECTED BRUCE M. GANS AS AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE AND ADAM D. PORTNOY AS A MANAGING TRUSTEE, EACH TO SERVE UNTIL THE 2016 ANNUAL MEETING OR UNTIL HIS SUCCESSOR IS QUALIFIED AND ASSUMES OFFICE.
 
THE RESULTS REPORTED ABOVE ARE FINAL VOTING RESULTS.

ON JUNE 1, 2015, WE ENTERED A TRANSACTION AGREEMENT, OR THE AGREEMENT, WITH TA TO ACQUIRE AND LEASEBACK 30 TRAVEL CENTERS FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $397 MILLION, OR THE TRANSACTION.  THE 30 SITES INCLUDE 11 SITES WHICH WE CURRENTLY OWN AND WHERE WE WILL ACQUIRE SOME OR ALL OF THE IMPROVEMENTS, LAND AND ANCILLARY PROPERTY OWNED BY TA.  THE AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES THAT WE WILL SELL FIVE TRAVEL CENTERS TO TA FOR APPROXIMATELY $45 MILLION.  THE ANNUAL NET CASH RENTAL INCREASE WHICH WE EXPECT TO REALIZE AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPECTED NET INVESTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $352 MILLION IS APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION PER YEAR, PLUS PERCENTAGE RENT IN THE FUTURE.
 
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE AGREEMENT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR AT DIFFERENT TIMES, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING:
 
·                 WE WILL ACQUIRE 25 TRAVEL CENTERS, INCLUDING THE 11 SITES WHICH WE CURRENTLY OWN AND WHERE WE WILL ACQUIRE SOME OR ALL OF THE IMPROVEMENTS, LAND AND ANCILLARY PROPERTY OWNED BY TA, FOR APPROXIMATELY $279 MILLION.  THE PURCHASE AND LEASEBACK OF MOST OF THESE SITES IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR BY JUNE 30, 2015; HOWEVER, TA HAS THE RIGHT TO DELAY THE CLOSING FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SITES UNTIL LATER IN 2015.
 
·                 WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE SITES THAT TA IS DEVELOPING.  THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THESE SITES WILL BE EQUAL TO TAS DEVELOPMENT COSTS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO TOTAL UP TO APPROXIMATELY $118 MILLION.  THE PURCHASE AND LEASEBACK OF THESE SITES IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR BEFORE JUNE 30, 2017, AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE SITES IS COMPLETED.
 
·                 WE WILL SELL TO TA FIVE TRAVEL CENTERS THAT WE CURRENTLY LEASE TO TA AND WHICH TA SUBLEASES TO ITS FRANCHISEES.  THESE SALES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR BEFORE JUNE 30, 2015.
 
AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION, WE AGREED TO EXPAND AND SUBDIVIDE OUR EXISTING TA LEASE NO. 1 UNDER WHICH WE CURRENTLY LEASE 144 TRAVEL CENTERS TO TA INTO FOUR AMENDED AND RESTATED LEASES, OR THE NEW TA LEASES.  SIGNIFICANT TERMS OF THE NEW TA LEASES ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW:
 
·                 THE NEW TA LEASES WILL COVER ALL TA TRAVEL CENTERS OWNED BY US (INCLUDING THOSE BEING ACQUIRED, LESS THOSE BEING SOLD) AND WILL EXTEND THE LEASE TERMS OF THESE TRAVEL CENTERS TO DECEMBER 31, 2026, 2028, 2029 AND 2030, RESPECTIVELY.  TA WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXTEND THE TERM OF EACH NEW TA LEASE FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE RENEWAL TERMS OF 15 YEARS EACH.
 
·                 THE AGGREGATE ANNUAL MINIMUM RENT UNDER THE NEW TA LEASES AFTER THE PURCHASES OF PROPERTIES FROM AND SALES OF PROPERTIES TO TA DESCRIBED ABOVE, EXCLUDING THE RENT RELATED TO THE PROPERTIES THAT WILL BE SOLD UPON COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT, WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $186 MILLION. THE MINIMUM RENT UNDER THE NEW TA LEASES IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IF TA SELLS TO US CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS IT MAKES AT THE LEASED PREMISES.
 
·                 PERCENTAGE RENT, WHICH TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION IN 2014 UNDER OUR TA LEASE NO. 1, WILL BE REDUCED UNDER THE NEW TA LEASES TO $0 FOR 2015, AND APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION WILL BE ADDED TO THE MINIMUM RENT UNDER THE NEW TA LEASES, WHICH AMOUNT IS INCLUDED IN AGGREGATE MINIMUM RENT DESCRIBED ABOVE.  THEREAFTER, PERCENTAGE RENT WILL EQUAL 3% OF THE EXCESS OF GROSS NON-FUEL REVENUES IN ANY PARTICULAR YEAR BEGINNING IN 2016, OVER BASE YEAR GROSS NON-FUEL REVENUES.
 
·                 ALL OF TAS OBLIGATIONS TO US WILL REMAIN GUARANTEED BY TA ON A FULL RECOURSE BASIS.
 
·                 THE NEW TA LEASES WILL EXTEND THE DUE DATE FOR PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED RENT UNDER OUR TA LEASE NO. 1 IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $107 MILLION WITH THE PORTION THEREOF ATTRIBUTABLE TO EACH NEW TA LEASE BECOMING DUE UPON THE EXPIRATION OR EARLIER TERMINATION OF THE INITIAL TERM OF SUCH LEASE.

INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
 
TA WAS FORMERLY A 100% OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF US UNTIL TAS SHARES WERE DISTRIBUTED TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AS A SPECIAL DIVIDEND IN 2007.

WARNING CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS.  ALSO, WHENEVER WE USE
 
3





 
WORDS SUCH AS BELIEVE,  EXPECT,  ANTICIPATE,  INTEND,  PLAN,  ESTIMATE OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, WE ARE MAKING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS.  THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON OUR PRESENT INTENT, BELIEFS OR EXPECTATIONS, BUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS.  FOR EXAMPLE:
 
·                 THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES THAT THE ANNUAL NET CASH RENTAL INCREASE WHICH WE WILL REALIZE AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE AGREEMENT WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION PER YEAR, PLUS PERCENTAGE RENT IN THE FUTURE.  THE PURCHASE, LEASE AND SALE OF THE TRAVEL CENTERS DISCUSSED HEREIN ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  WHEN CERTAIN PROPERTIES ARE SOLD BY US TO TA, OUR RENTAL INCOME WILL DECLINE; AND WHEN PROPERTIES ARE BOUGHT BY US AND LEASED TO TA, OUR RENTAL INCOME WILL INCREASE.  UNTIL THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE AGREEMENT ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED, THE RENTAL INCOME WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE FROM TA MAY DECLINE ON AN INTERIM BASIS AND THE INCREASE IN RENTAL INCOME WE WILL REALIZE MAY BE LESS THAN $30 MILLION PER YEAR.  ALSO, THE PERCENTAGE RENT PAYABLE BY TA TO US IS BASED UPON INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF NON-FUEL SALES OVER CERTAIN THRESHOLD AMOUNTS AT THE SITES LEASED BY TA FROM US.  THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT TAS SALES WILL INCREASE OR THAT ANY PERCENTAGE RENT WILL BE PAID TO US IN THE FUTURE.
 
·                  THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES SEVERAL TIME PERIODS WHEN CERTAIN SALES ARE EXPECTED TO CLOSE.  LARGE AND COMPLEX REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN MULTIPLE LEGAL JURISDICTIONS LIKE THOSE DESCRIBED HEREIN OFTEN TAKE LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED.  WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE AGREEMENT WILL OCCUR WITHIN THE TIMES PERIODS SPECIFIED HEREIN AND THEY MAY NOT OCCUR.
 
·                 THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES THAT WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE FIVE SITES WHICH TA IS DEVELOPING, THAT THE PURCHASE PRICES FOR THESE SITES WILL BE EQUAL TO TAS DEVELOPMENT COSTS WHICH ARE ESTIMATED TO BE UP TO APPROXIMATELY $118 MILLION, AND THAT THE PURCHASE AND LEASEBACK OF THESE SITES IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR AS DEVELOPMENT OF THESE SITES IS COMPLETED BEFORE JUNE 30, 2017.  TA HAS BEGUN CONSTRUCTION AT SOME, BUT NOT ALL, OF THESE SITES.  OBTAINING GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS TO BUILD TRAVEL CENTERS IS OFTEN A COMPLEX AND TIME CONSUMING PROCESS.  WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT TA WILL OBTAIN ALL REQUIRED APPROVALS TO DEVELOP ALL FIVE SITES.  IF REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS ARE NOT OBTAINED OR IF CERTAIN SITES ARE NOT DEVELOPED FOR OTHER REASONS, WE MAY ACQUIRE LESS THAN FIVE SITES OR DIFFERENT SITES MAY BE AGREED FOR SALE AND LEASEBACK BETWEEN US AND TA.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO DEVELOP NEW TRAVEL CENTERS.  WE AND TA HAVE AGREED THAT WE WILL PURCHASE THESE PROPERTIES FOR TAS COST OF DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE UP TO APPROXIMATELY $118 MILLION, BUT THAT COST MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN THE $118 MILLION ESTIMATE.  ALSO, CONSTRUCTION OF NEW TRAVEL CENTERS MAY BE DELAYED FOR VARIOUS REASONS SUCH AS LABOR STRIFE, WEATHER CONDITIONS, THE UNAVAILABILITY OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, ETC.; AND THE PURCHASE AND LEASEBACK OF THESE SITES MAY BE DELAYED BEYOND JUNE 30, 2017.

·                 THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES THAT THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT WERE NEGOTIATED AND APPROVED BY SPECIAL COMMITTEES OF OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES AND TAS INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS WHO WERE REPRESENTED BY SEPARATE COUNSEL.  AN IMPLICATION OF THESE STATEMENTS MAY BE THAT THE AGREEMENTS ARE EQUIVALENT TO ARMS LENGTH AGREEMENTS BETWEEN UNRELATED PARTIES.  WE AND TA ARE AFFILIATED BECAUSE WE HAVE A COMMON BOARD MEMBER, BECAUSE WE BOTH HAVE CERTAIN MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS WITH THE SAME COMPANY AND OTHERWISE.  ALSO, AN AGREEMENT WHICH WAS ENTERED INTO BY US AND TA AT THE TIME TA WAS SPUN OUT OF US TO BECOME A SEPARATE PUBLIC COMPANY GRANTS US CERTAIN RIGHTS OF FIRST REFUSAL REGARDING TAS REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.  ACCORDINGLY, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS DESCRIBED HEREIN ARE EQUIVALENT TO ARMS LENGTH AGREEMENTS.
 
THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SEC, INCLUDING UNDER THE CAPTION RISK FACTORS IN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS, OR INCORPORATED THEREIN, IDENTIFIES OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE DIFFERENCES FROM OUR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS.

OUR AND THE OTHER REITS ACQUISITION OF INC SHARES WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF AN UP-C TRANSACTION STRUCTURE IN WHICH OUR COMMON SHARES, TOGETHER WITH COMMON SHARES OF THE OTHER REITS AND CASH IN THE AMOUNTS PAID TO RMR INC, WERE PAID BY RMR INC TO RMR TRUST TO ACQUIRE ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN RMR LLC.  IN THE UP-C TRANSACTION, RMR TRUST RECEIVED SHARES OF RMR INCS CLASS B-2 COMMON STOCK, WHICH HAVE 10:1 VOTING RIGHTS AND NO ECONOMIC INTEREST, AND ARE PAIRED WITH RMR TRUSTS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN RMR LLC.  ADDITIONALLY, RMR TRUST ACQUIRED SHARES OF RMR INCS CLASS B-1 COMMON STOCK FOR CASH AT THE SAME PER SHARE PRICE THAT WE PAID FOR THE INC SHARES WE ACQUIRED.  THE CLASS B-1 SHARES HAVE 10:1 VOTING RIGHTS, BUT OTHERWISE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS THE CLASS A COMMON STOCK.  IN THE AGGREGATE, RMR TRUST OWNS, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, 51.6% OF RMR LLC, AND RMR TRUST OWNS 91.4% OF THE VOTING RIGHTS IN RMR INC.  AS A RESULT, SO LONG AS RMR TRUST DOES NOT CONVERT ITS OWNERSHIP IN RMR LLC INTO COMMON SHARES OF RMR INC, OR SELL THE SHARES OF RMR INC IT RECEIVED IN THE TRANSACTION TO UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES, RMR TRUST, WHICH IS BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY MR. BARRY PORTNOY AND MR. ADAM PORTNOY, WILL CONTROL RMR INC AND WILL CONTINUE TO CONTROL RMR LLC.
 
OUR COMMON SHARES THAT WE ISSUED TO RMR INC AND THE INC SHARES THAT WE ACQUIRED ARE UNREGISTERED.  CONCURRENTLY WITH ENTERING INTO THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT, WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A REGISTRATION RIGHTS AND LOCK-UP AGREEMENT BY AND AMONG US, RMR TRUST, MR. BARRY PORTNOY AND MR. ADAM PORTNOY WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMON SHARES, PURSUANT TO WHICH RMR TRUST, MR. BARRY PORTNOY AND MR. ADAM PORTNOY EACH AGREED NOT TO TRANSFER OUR COMMON SHARES ACQUIRED BY RMR TRUST FROM RMR INC FOR A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND RECEIVED DEMAND AND PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS.  WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT WITH RMR INC WITH RESPECT TO THE INC SHARES THAT WE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE RECEIVED DEMAND AND PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS.
 
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS THEREOF WERE NEGOTIATED AND REVIEWED BY A JOINT SPECIAL COMMITTEE COMPRISED SOLELY OF OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES AND THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES OF THE OTHER REITS, OR THE JOINT SPECIAL COMMITTEE, AND WERE SEPARATELY APPROVED AND ADOPTED BY OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE WHO DOES NOT SERVE AS AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE OF ANY OF THE OTHER REITS, OR OUR DISINTERESTED TRUSTEE, BY A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES, COMPRISED SOLELY OF OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, OR OUR SPECIAL COMMITTEE, AND BY OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES.  MORGAN STANLEY & CO. LLC ACTED AS FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO THE JOINT SPECIAL COMMITTEE AND HOULIHAN LOKEY CAPITAL, INC. ACTED AS FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO OUR SPECIAL COMMITTEE.
 
THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT, THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AND LOCK-UP AGREEMENT AND THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT COMPLETE AND ARE QUALIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT, THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AND LOCK-UP AGREEMENT AND THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, WHICH ARE FILED AS EXHIBITS 10.1, 10.4 AND 10.5, RESPECTIVELY, TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K, AND ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.
 
THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K REFERS TO AN ANTICIPATED DISTRIBUTION OF INC SHARES WE AND THE OTHER REITS HAVE AGREED TO MAKE TO OUR AND THE OTHER REITS SHAREHOLDERS.  THIS DISTRIBUTION WILL BE MADE ONLY AFTER A REGISTRATION STATEMENT, INCLUDING A PROSPECTUS, IS FILED BY RMR INC AND DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC.  THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL OR SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY SHARES OF RMR INC, US OR ANY OTHER REIT.

IF WE TERMINATE EITHER OF THE AMENDED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR CONVENIENCE, OR IF RMR LLC TERMINATES EITHER OF THE AMENDED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR GOOD REASON, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY RMR LLC A TERMINATION FEE IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE MONTHLY FUTURE FEES, AS DEFINED THEREIN, FOR THE RESPECTIVE AMENDED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, FOR THE REMAINING TERM, CALCULATING THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE MONTHLY FUTURE FEES BY APPLYING A DISCOUNT RATE EQUAL TO 1/12 OF THE SUM OF THE APPLICABLE TREASURY RATE, AS DEFINED THEREIN, PLUS 300 BASIS POINTS.  IF WE TERMINATE EITHER OF THE AMENDED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS BASED ON PERFORMANCE, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY RMR LLC A TERMINATION FEE IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE MONTHLY FUTURE FEES, AS DEFINED THEREIN, FOR THE RESPECTIVE AMENDED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, ASSUMING A REMAINING TERM OF 10 YEARS.
 
THE AMENDED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN PROPORTIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TERMINATION FEES IF WE MERGE WITH ANOTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST TO WHICH RMR LLC IS PROVIDING MANAGEMENT SERVICES OR IF WE SPIN-OFF A SUBSIDIARY OF OURS TO WHICH WE CONTRIBUTED PROPERTIES AND TO WHICH RMR LLC IS PROVIDING MANAGEMENT SERVICES BOTH AT THE TIME OF THE SPIN-OFF AND ON THE DATE OF THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF EITHER OF THE AMENDED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS.

ON JUNE 8, 2015, WE REINSTATED AN AGREEMENT, OR THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO FOR OUR PURCHASE OF A PORTFOLIO OF EXTENDED STAY HOTELS.  AS REINSTATED, THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR OUR PURCHASE OF NINE HOTELS WITH 1,094 SUITES LOCATED IN EIGHT STATES FOR APPROXIMATELY $85 MILLION, EXCLUDING CLOSING COSTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT, SUBJECT TO THE COMPLETION OF OUR ACCOUNTING ANALYSIS, THE PURCHASE PRICE REPRESENTS AN ACQUISITION CAP RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 10.1% BASED ON OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF 2014 PROPERTY LEVEL REVENUES AFTER PROPERTY LEVEL EXPENSES INCLUDING MANAGEMENT AND FRANCHISE FEES.  THE NINE HOTELS ARE CURRENTLY OPERATED AS RESIDENCE INNS BY MARRIOTT® (8 HOTELS) AND HOMEWOOD SUITES® BY HILTON (1 HOTEL) HOTELS.  WE EXPECT TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $45 MILLION TO SUBSTANTIALLY RENOVATE THESE HOTELS IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR CONVERSION TO THE UPSCALE, EXTENDED STAY SONESTA ES SUITES® HOTEL BRAND AND TO ENTER INTO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR THESE NINE HOTELS WITH SONESTA INTERNATIONAL HOTELS CORPORATION, OR SONESTA.  WE EXPECT THAT THESE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WILL BE POOLED WITH OUR OTHER SONESTA MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS UNDER OUR EXISTING POOLING AGREEMENT WITH SONESTA, OR THE POOLING AGREEMENT.
 
WE EXPECT THAT THE TERMS OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR THE NINE HOTELS WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THOSE CONTAINED IN OUR EXISTING POOLED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH SONESTA RELATING TO LIMITED SERVICE HOTELS.

OUR ACQUISITION OF THE NINE HOTELS, THE AMOUNT OF OUR PLANNED RENOVATION INVESTMENT, THE PLANNED CONVERSION OF THE HOTELS TO THE SONESTA ES SUITES® BRAND, OUR EXPECTED ENTRY INTO THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH SONESTA AND THE EXPECTED POOLING OF THOSE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WERE APPROVED BY OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.
 
THE CLOSING OF THE PURCHASE OF THE NINE HOTELS UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND OUR ENTERING INTO THE NEW MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH SONESTA ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON OR ABOUT JULY 23, 2015.

WARNING CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
THIS CURRENT REPORT CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS.  ALSO, WHENEVER WE USE WORDS SUCH AS BELIEVE, EXPECT, ANTICIPATE, INTEND, PLAN, ESTIMATE OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, WE ARE MAKING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS.  THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON OUR PRESENT INTENT, BELIEFS OR EXPECTATIONS, BUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS.  FOR EXAMPLE:
 
·                  THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES THAT WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE NINE HOTELS.  THE PURCHASE OF THESE HOTELS IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES WHICH MAY NOT BE SATISFIED AND THE PENDING ACQUISITION MAY NOT OCCUR, MAY BE DELAYED OR THE TERMS OF SUCH TRANSACTION MAY CHANGE.
 
·                  THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES THAT WE PLAN TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $45 MILLION TO CONVERT THE NINE HOTELS TO THE SONESTA ES SUITES® HOTEL BRAND.  THE COSTS OF SUCH CONVERSIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT AMOUNT.
 
·                  THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES THAT, PENDING COMPLETION OF OUR ACCOUNTING ANALYSIS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE NINE HOTELS REPRESENTS AN ACQUISITION CAP RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 10.1% BASED OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF 2014 PROPERTY LEVEL REVENUES AFTER PROPERTY LEVEL EXPENSES INCLUDING MANAGEMENT AND FRANCHISE FEES.  OUR FINAL ACCOUNTING ANALYSIS MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF 2014 PROPERTY LEVEL REVENUES AFTER MANAGEMENT AND FRANCHISE FEES AND OTHER PROPERTY LEVEL EXPENSES.  AS A RESULT, THE ACTUAL ACQUISITION CAP RATE MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN 10.1%.
 
·                  THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES THAT WE EXPECT TO CONVERT THE NINE HOTELS TO THE SONESTA ES SUITES® HOTEL BRAND AND TO ENTER NEW MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH SONESTA THAT ARE POOLED UNDER OUR EXISTING POOLING AGREEMENT WITH SONESTA.  THE IMPLICATION OF THIS STATEMENT MAY BE THAT WE EXPECT THESE HOTELS TO PERFORM BETTER UNDER THE SONESTA ES SUITES® BRAND WITH SONESTA MANAGEMENT THAN THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY PERFORMED WITH THEIR CURRENT BRANDS AND MANAGERS.  IN FACT, PERFORMANCE MAY NOT IMPROVE DUE TO RENOVATION ACTIVITY, THE RELATIVE BRAND AWARENESS OF SONESTA ES SUITES® BRAND COMPARED TO THE CURRENT BRANDS, THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT BRANDS GUEST AFFINITY PROGRAMS OR FOR OTHER REASONS.
 
·                  THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES THAT OUR ACQUISITION OF THE NINE HOTELS, THE AMOUNT OF OUR PLANNED RENOVATION INVESTMENT, THE PLANNED CONVERSION OF THE HOTELS TO THE SONESTA ES SUITES® BRAND, OUR EXPECTED ENTRY INTO THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH SONESTA AND THE POOLING OF THOSE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WERE APPROVED BY OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.  THE IMPLICATION OF THIS STATEMENT MAY BE THAT THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS ARE AS FAVORABLE TO US AS WE COULD OBTAIN FOR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS FROM UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES. HOWEVER, DESPITE THESE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS, WE COULD STILL BE SUBJECTED TO CLAIMS CHALLENGING OUR ENTRY INTO THIS TRANSACTION BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG US, SONESTA AND RMR AND THEIR RELATED PERSONS AND ENTITIES, AND DEFENDING SUCH CLAIMS COULD BE EXPENSIVE AND DISTRACTING TO MANAGEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE MERITS OF SUCH CLAIMS.

GEB 2015-2020 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
 
THE COMMITTEE HAS ESTABLISHED THE GEB PLAN FOR THE SIX-YEAR PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2015 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2020.
 
THE PURPOSES OF THE GEB PLAN (WITH CAPITALIZED TERMS HAVING THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM IN THE GEB PLAN) ARE TO:
 
(I)                       PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO THE PARTICIPANTS TO PLAN, DEVELOP AND EXECUTE THE LONG-TERM STRATEGIC GOALS OF THE COMPANY,
 
(II)                    ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF THE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE INTERESTS OF COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING A MECHANISM FOR DELIVERING DIRECT EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN THE COMPANY TO THE PARTICIPANTS, AND
 
(III)                ATTRACT AND RETAIN EXECUTIVE TALENT IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKET.
 
THE GEB PLAN IS INTENDED TO BE A VARIABLE COMPENSATION PLAN UNDER THE SAIP. ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMPANYS GLOBAL EXECUTIVE BOARD AND SUCH OTHER EXECUTIVES AND KEY CONTRIBUTORS AS THE COMMITTEE MAY DESIGNATE FROM TIME TO TIME. NO INDIVIDUAL WILL HAVE AN AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN.
 
PRIOR TO MARCH 30 OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANYS CEO WILL RECOMMEND EMPLOYEES TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SPECIFIC LEVELS OF PROPOSED PARTICIPATION. AS AND TO THE EXTENT DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE AS PART OF THE ANNUAL COMPENSATION PLANNING PROCESS FOR 
 
4





 
PARTICIPANTS, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF LASALLE WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE GEB PLAN AS WELL AS THE LASALLE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME.
 
FOR PURPOSES OF THE GEB PLAN, PERFORMANCE WILL BE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING THREE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AS OF THE END OF EACH CALENDAR YEAR (EACH, A PERFORMANCE PERIOD):
 
1) EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA).
EBITDA WILL BE DERIVED FROM THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED PURSUANT TO GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AS IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME AND REPORTED IN THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE COMMITTEE RESERVES THE RIGHT IN ITS DISCRETION TO EXCLUDE ANY INCOME OR TO INCLUDE ANY EXPENSE ITEMS OF A NONRECURRING, UNUSUAL, OR NON-OPERATIONAL NATURE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE (I) THE CONSEQUENCES OF A SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITION, (II) CERTAIN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND (III) INCENTIVE FEES AND EQUITY EARNINGS.
 
2) RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR). THE COMPANYS TSR WILL BE RANKED VERSUS THE COMPANIES IN THE RUSSELL 3000 INDEX.  THE COMPANYS TSR WILL BE CALCULATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR FOLLOWING EACH PERFORMANCE PERIOD AND IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR IN THE GEB PLAN.
 
3) 2020 LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES: THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED ITS 2020 STRATEGY (2020) TO DEFINE ITS LONG TERM PRIORITIES AND SEEK TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN PROFIT AND GROWTH GOALS DESIGNED TO RETAIN ITS POSITION AS ONE OF THE WORLDS LEADING REAL ESTATE SERVICES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES. COMPANY-WIDE AND INDIVIDUAL 2020 CATEGORIES MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY, PLATFORM, LEADERSHIP, AND PRODUCTIVITY.  EACH YEAR, IN ITS DISCRETION, BASED ON INFORMATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CEO, THE COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH COMPANY-WIDE AND INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED, WHICH DETERMINATION IS FINAL.
 
PERFORMANCE SCORES FOR 2020 OBJECTIVES WILL BE CALCULATED ANNUALLY BASED ON PROGRESS ON 2020 OBJECTIVES.  THE EVALUATION PERIODS FOR EBITDA AND RELATIVE TSR WILL BE CUMULATIVE BASED ON THE TABLE BELOW:

THE FUNDING TARGET FOR THE GEB PLAN WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE BY MARCH 30TH OF EACH YEAR AND WILL BE BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF EBITDA (THE GEB LTIP POOL). THE ANNUAL FUNDING MAXIMUM WILL BE 150% OF TARGET.
 
TO DIFFERENTIATE PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED AND THE VALUE OF AWARDS AT THE END OF EACH PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EACH PERFORMANCE MEASURE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED A RELATIVE IMPORTANCE WEIGHTING AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW (EACH A  FUNDING TARGET):

FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE VALUE OF AN AWARD UNDER THE PLAN (AN AWARD), EACH PARTICIPANT WILL SHARE IN A SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF THE GEB LTIP POOL AS ESTABLISHED FOR EACH PERFORMANCE PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE INTERESTS OF ALL PARTICIPANTS SHALL NOT EXCEED 100%. PERCENTAGE INTERESTS THAT WERE INITIALLY ASSIGNED TO A PARTICIPANT AT THE BEGINNING OF A PERFORMANCE PERIOD AND ARE FORFEITED UPON THE PARTICIPANTS TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DURING THAT PERFORMANCE PERIOD MAY NOT BE REALLOCATED TO OTHER PARTICIPANTS FOR SUCH PERFORMANCE PERIOD.
 
AT THE END OF EACH PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE COMMITTEE SHALL REVIEW PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED ON EACH PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. A PARTICIPANTS AWARD IS DETERMINED FROM HIS OR HER SHARE OF THE AVAILABLE GEB LTIP POOL AND THE RELATIVE ACHIEVEMENT AND WEIGHTING OF EACH PERFORMANCE MEASURE.
 
THE PAYOUT FOR EACH PERFORMANCE MEASURE WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE PAYOUT CURVE AS SHOWN IN THE BELOW.  ACHIEVEMENT BETWEEN ANCHORS WILL BE INTERPOLATED.

THE VESTING DATE (EACH A VESTING DATE) FOR RSU AWARDS SHALL BE DETERMINED AS FOLLOWS:  SUBJECT TO SPECIAL CONSIDERATION GIVEN FOR DIFFERENT TERMINATION EVENTS DESCRIBED BELOW, ONE THIRD (1/3) OF ANY RSU AWARD WILL VEST ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE AWARD DATE, ONE THIRD (1/3) OF ANY RSU AWARD WILL VEST ON THE 2ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE AWARD DATE, AND ONE THIRD (1/3) OF ANY RSU AWARD WILL VEST ON THE 3RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE AWARD DATE.

ONCE AN RSU AWARD HAS VESTED, WHILE REMAINING EMPLOYED THE PARTICIPANT SHALL RETAIN THE SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS AFTER THE VESTING DATE.
 
TREATMENT OF RSU AWARDS UPON CERTAIN EVENTS OF TERMINATION AND CHANGE OF CONTROL ARE PROVIDED IN THE GEB PLAN. SUBJECT TO SPECIAL CONSIDERATION GIVEN FOR SUCH DIFFERENT TERMINATION, A PARTICIPANT MUST BE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY (OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) ON A VESTING DATE TO VEST IN AN RSU AWARD THAT VESTS ON SUCH VESTING DATE UNLESS THE PARTICIPANT HAS QUALIFIED FOR RETIREMENT.
 
TO THE EXTENT LEGALLY REQUIRED, OR IF THE COMMITTEE DETERMINES THAT ANY FRAUD OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT BY ONE OR MORE PARTICIPANTS CAUSED THE COMPANY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO RESTATE ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMMITTEE MAY REQUIRE REIMBURSEMENT OF ANY COMPENSATION PAID OR AWARDED TO PARTICIPANTS UNDER THE PLAN, AS WELL AS CANCEL UNVESTED RSU AWARDS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED TO SUCH PARTICIPANTS IN THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE PARTICIPANTS RESPECTIVE COMPENSATION EXCEEDED ANY LOWER PAYMENT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE BASED ON THE RESTATED FINANCIAL RESULTS.

S.À R.L. (MEDIAN). THE INITIAL STAGE OF THE TRANSACTION WAS COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 15, 2014 WHEN AN AFFILIATE OF WATERLAND PRIVATE EQUITY FUND V C.V. (WATERLAND) ACQUIRED 94.9% OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS
IN MEDIAN AND WE INDIRECTLY ACQUIRED THE REMAINING 5.1% OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS IN MEDIAN. IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING AND SUBSEQUENTLY THROUGH THE DATE OF THIS CURRENT REPORT, WE PROVIDED INTERIM ACQUISITION AND DEBT DISCHARGE LOANS
TO AFFILIATES OF WATERLAND AND MEDIAN IN CUMULATIVE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY 665 MILLION.  AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED,
ON APRIL 29, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF DEFINITIVE SALE-LEASEBACK AGREEMENTS WITH MEDIAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE AGREED TO PURCHASE THE REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF 31 HOSPITALS OWNED BY MEDIAN FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY
647 MILLION, AND WE EXPECT TO ENTER INTO SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR SALE-LEASEBACK AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE THE REAL ESTATE OF ADDITIONAL FACILITIES FROM MEDIAN, RESULTING IN AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE FOR ALL ACQUIRED FACILITIES OF
APPROXIMATELY 705 MILLION. CLOSING OF THE SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS, WHICH BEGAN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2015, IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY REAL ESTATE, REGULATORY AND OTHER CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WAIVER OF ANY STATUTORY PRE-EMPTION
RIGHTS BY LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND ANTITRUST CLEARANCE. AT EACH CLOSING, THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR EACH FACILITY WILL BE REDUCED AND OFFSET AGAINST THE INTERIM LOANS MADE TO AFFILIATES OF WATERLAND AND MEDIAN AS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND AGAINST THE AMOUNT
OF ANY DEBT ASSUMED OR REPAID BY US IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING.  AS OF JULY 6, 2015, WE HAVE CLOSED ON 20 OF THE PROPERTIES
SUBJECT TO THE AGREEMENTS FOR A CUMULATIVE PURCHASE PRICE TO DATE OF APPROXIMATELY 362 MILLION. THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR EACH OF THESE PROPERTIES WAS OFFSET DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR AGAINST THE OUTSTANDING INTERIM LOANS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND AGAINST
THE AMOUNT OF ANY DEBT ASSUMED OR REPAID BY US IN CONNECTION WITH CLOSING. AS A RESULT, WE WERE NOT REQUIRED TO FUND ANY NEW CASH AMOUNTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSINGS OF THESE ACQUISITIONS.

THE MODIFIED GUIDANCE DISCLOSED IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K IS BASED UPON A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SUFFICIENTLY SPECIFIC AND ARE REASONABLE, THEY ARE NEVERTHELESS SUBJECT TO BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE UNCERTAINTIES.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY’S ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES.  IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SET FORTH IN OUR PERIODIC FILINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”).

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE MEASURES ARE HELPFUL TO INVESTORS IN MEASURING ITS PERFORMANCE AND COMPARING SUCH PERFORMANCE TO OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (“REITS”).  SINCE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS INCLUDABLE IN NET INCOME, RELIANCE ON THE MEASURES HAS LIMITATIONS; MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY USING THE MEASURES SIMPLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ARE WEIGHED IN BALANCE WITH OTHER GAAP AND NON-GAAP MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIONS OF THE COMPANY’S CASH FLOW AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH NEEDS.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR PAY DEBT SERVICE.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (“FFO” OR “FFO PER NAREIT”) DEFINED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) COMPUTED USING GAAP, EXCLUDING GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  WHEN MULTIPLE PROPERTIES CONSISTING OF BOTH OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING PROPERTIES EXIST ON A SINGLE TAX PARCEL, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ALL OF THE GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, THE TAX PARCEL AS ALL BEING FOR PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES WHEN MOST OF THE VALUE OF THE PARCEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING PROPERTIES ON THE PARCEL.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT USES THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST’S (“NAREIT”) DEFINITION OF FFO, ALTHOUGH OTHERS MAY INTERPRET THE DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY’S PRESENTATION OF FFO MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO IS USEFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE, BY EXCLUDING GAINS RELATED TO SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, FFO CAN HELP ONE COMPARE ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFO.BASIC FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“BASIC FFO”) THIS MEASURE IS FFO ADJUSTED TO SUBTRACT (1) PREFERRED SHARE DIVIDENDS, (2) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF PREFERRED UNITS IN CORPORATE OFFICE PROPERTIES, L.P. (THE “OPERATING PARTNERSHIP”) OR INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES NOT OWNED BY THE COMPANY, (3) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ALLOCABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES, (4) BASIC FFO ALLOCABLE TO RESTRICTED SHARES AND (5) ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS, BASIC FFO REPRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND HOLDERS OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP (“COMMON UNITS”).  COMMON UNITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE COMPANY’S COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST (“COMMON SHARES”) AND ARE EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASIC FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS DUE TO THE CLOSE CORRELATION OF COMMON UNITS TO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO BASIC FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“DILUTED FFO”) DILUTED FFO IS BASIC FFO ADJUSTED TO ADD BACK ANY CHANGES IN BASIC FFO THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE ASSUMED CONVERSION OF SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED FFO ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT IS THE NUMERATOR USED TO COMPUTE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE, DISCUSSED BELOW.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO DILUTED FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY (“DILUTED FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY”) AND FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY DEFINED AS DILUTED FFO OR FFO ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE: OPERATING PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS: GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PROPERTIES OTHER THAN PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES, NET OF ASSOCIATED INCOME TAX; GAIN OR LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; FFO ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTIES SECURING NON-RECOURSE DEBT ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DEFAULTED AND WHICH THE COMPANY HAS EXTINGUISHED, OR EXPECTS TO EXTINGUISH, VIA CONVEYANCE OF THOSE PROPERTIES (INCLUDING PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND GAINS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT); LOSS ON INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES; EXECUTIVE TRANSITION COSTS; AND ACCOUNTING CHARGES FOR ORIGINAL ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS AND, AS A RESULT, BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE ADJUSTMENT FOR FFO ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTIES SECURING NON-RECOURSE DEBT ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DEFAULTED PERTAINS TO THE PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO ITS DEFAULT ON THE LOAN’S PAYMENT TERMS, WHICH IS THE RESULT OF ITS DECISION TO NOT SUPPORT PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN.  WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUES AS THE LEGAL OWNER OF THE PROPERTIES DURING THIS PERIOD, ALL CASH FLOWS PRODUCED BY THE PROPERTIES GO DIRECTLY TO THE LENDER AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT FUND ANY DEBT SERVICE SHORTFALLS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE.DILUTED FFO PER SHARE (“FFOPS”)FFOPS IS (1) DILUTED FFO DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE COMPUTATION OF FFOPS ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFOPS IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH A FURTHER CONTEXT FOR EVALUATING OUR FFO RESULTS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT INVESTORS USE EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) IN EVALUATING NET (LOSS) INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFOPS.FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITYDEFINED AS (1) DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE COMPUTATION OF THIS MEASURE ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE THE PER SHARE MEASURE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS.  AS SUCH, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

AS A RESULT
OF EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2015 TERM LOAN FACILITY, ON DECEMBER 16, 2015, OMEGA ENTERED
INTO VARIOUS FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED $250 MILLION OF OMEGA'S
VARIABLE-RATE DEBT BASED ON ONE-MONTH LIBOR TO AN AGGREGATE FIXED RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 3.8005% EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 2016. THIS
FIXED RATE COULD VARY UP BY 55 BASIS POINTS OR DOWN BY 40 BASIS POINTS BASED ON FUTURE CHANGES TO OMEGA'S CREDIT RATINGS.
EACH OF THESE SWAPS BEGINS ON DECEMBER 30, 2016 AND MATURES IN DECEMBER 2022.  OMEGA EXPECTS THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO BE
EFFECTIVE FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.  THE PURPOSE OF ENTERING INTO THE SWAPS WAS TO REDUCE OMEGA'S EXPOSURE TO VARIABLE
INTEREST RATES. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS SETTLE ON A MONTHLY BASIS WHEN INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE MADE AND WILL OCCUR THROUGH THE
MATURITY DATE OF THE 2015 TERM LOAN FACILITY.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2015, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST ADOPTED THE LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST SENIOR OFFICER SEVERANCE PLAN (THE PLAN), WHICH AMENDS AND RESTATES THE LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST MANAGEMENT SEVERANCE PLAN.  THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR PAYMENTS AND OTHER BENEFITS TO EACH OF THE COMPANYS NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (EACH, AN NEO AND, COLLECTIVELY, THE NEOS), IF (I) LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST OR LIBERTY PROPERTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (TOGETHER, THE COMPANY) TERMINATES THE NEOS EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT CAUSE OR (II) THE NEO TERMINATES EMPLOYMENT FOR GOOD REASON, IN EITHER CASE WITHIN SIX MONTHS BEFORE OR TWO YEARS FOLLOWING A CHANGE OF CONTROL (THE CHANGE OF CONTROL PERIOD).
 
PURSUANT TO THE PLAN, IF, DURING THE CHANGE OF CONTROL PERIOD, AN NEOS EMPLOYMENT IS TERMINATED BY THE COMPANY WITHOUT CAUSE OR THE NEO TERMINATES HIS EMPLOYMENT FOR GOOD REASON, THE NEO WILL RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING, PROVIDED THAT THE NEO EXECUTES AND DOES NOT REVOKE A GENERAL RELEASE AND WAIVER OF CLAIMS IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES:
 
·                                          A LUMP SUM SEVERANCE PAYMENT EQUAL TO A MULTIPLIER TIMES THE SUM OF (1) THE NEOS CURRENT ANNUAL BASE SALARY, PLUS (2) THE NEOS HIGHEST TARGET ANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUS DURING THE CHANGE OF CONTROL PERIOD.  THE APPLICABLE SEVERANCE MULTIPLIERS ARE 3.0X FOR THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND 2.0X FOR THE OTHER NEOS.  THESE MULTIPLIERS ARE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED AS COMPARED TO THE MULTIPLIERS USED IN THE PRIOR PLAN, WHICH WERE 2.99X AND 1.99X, RESPECTIVELY;
 
·                                          A LUMP SUM PAYMENT REPRESENTING A PRO RATA PORTION, THROUGH THE DATE OF TERMINATION, OF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE AWARD PAID TO THE NEO UNDER THE COMPANYS ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN FOR THE PRIOR THREE FISCAL YEARS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE NEOS TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT;
 
·                                          A LUMP SUM PAYMENT EQUAL TO ONE AND ONE-HALF TIMES THE NEOS MONTHLY COST TO CONTINUE MEDICAL AND DENTAL COVERAGE UNDER THE COMPANYS APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLANS FOR THE NEO AND THE NEOS SPOUSE/DOMESTIC PARTNER AND DEPENDENTS FOR 18 MONTHS, LESS THE AMOUNT AN ACTIVE EMPLOYEE WOULD PAY FOR SIMILAR COVERAGE;
 
·                                          A LUMP SUM PAYMENT OF $10,000 IN LIEU OF CONTINUED COVERAGE UNDER THE COMPANYS LIFE INSURANCE, ACCIDENT AND DISABILITY PLANS; AND
 
·                                          ALL OPTIONS, RESTRICTED SHARES, RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS AND OTHER EQUITY COMPENSATION HELD BY THE NEO WILL AUTOMATICALLY VEST; PROVIDED THAT ANY PERFORMANCE-BASED EQUITY COMPENSATION WILL VEST BASED ON TARGET PERFORMANCE.
 
NEOS ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE UNDER THE PLAN FOR AN ADDITIONAL GROSS-UP PAYMENT TO COVER ANY EXCISE TAX IMPOSED BY SECTION 4999 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE CODE).  IF THE PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS OTHERWISE PAYABLE TO AN NEO UNDER THE PLAN OR OTHERWISE WOULD CONSTITUTE EXCESS PARACHUTE PAYMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 280G OF THE CODE,
 
1





 
THEN THE COMPANY WILL REDUCE SUCH PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS TO AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD AVOID ANY EXCISE TAXES UNDER SECTION 4999 OF THE CODE, PROVIDED THAT SUCH REDUCTION WOULD PROVIDE THE NEO WITH A GREATER NET AFTER-TAX BENEFIT THAN WOULD NO REDUCTION.

RISK FACTOR  THE OFFERING OF TAX-EXEMPT PUBLIC
INFRASTRUCTURE BONDS TO FINANCE THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE ADELAAR PROJECT MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR THE COMPANY COULD OVERRUN BUDGETED COSTS FOR SUCH INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION. 
THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ADELAAR PROJECT COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE FINANCED PRIMARILY
THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF TAX-EXEMPT PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE BONDS. THE DEBT SERVICE OF THESE BONDS IS EXPECTED TO BE PAID PRIMARILY THROUGH SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST THE PROPERTY HELD BY THE BENEFITED USERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE
OFFERING OF TAX-EXEMPT PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE BONDS WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED. IF THE BONDS ARE NOT ISSUED, THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECEIVE THE PROCEEDS OF THE BOND OFFERING AS REIMBURSEMENT OF ITS EXPENDITURES AND THOSE AMOUNTS WILL BE TREATED AS
AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THE ADELAAR PROJECT (SUBJECT TO A PORTION OF THOSE COSTS BEING PROPORTIONATELY REIMBURSED BY THE COMPANYS TENANTS) IN WHICH CASE THE COMPANYS RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL WOULD BE LESS THAN CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE ADELAAR PROJECT WILL NOT EXCEED THE COMPANYS BUDGETED AMOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY $90.0 MILLION, SUBJECT TO BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS AND RELATED
APPROVALS. IF SO, SUCH EXCESS MAY NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE TAX-EXEMPT PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE BONDS AND, TO THE EXTENT THEY EXCEED CERTAIN NEGOTIATED CAPS, MAY NOT BE PROPORTIONATELY RECOVERED FROM THE COMPANYS TENANTS.

HOWEVER, IT HAS MODIFIED ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED GUIDANCE FOR FFOPS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) FOR THOSE PERIODS TO REFLECT THE EFFECT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES DESCRIBED BELOW AND HIGHER THAN PROJECTED GAINS ON SALES OF OPERATING PROPERTIES.  DURING THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOLLOWING:•$12.8 MILLION ON LAND IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO.  THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT SOME OF THIS LAND SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE DURING THE PERIOD BECAUSE THE LAND WAS BEING ACTIVELY MARKETED AND EXPECTED TO BE SOLD WITHIN ONE YEAR.  THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LAND HELD FOR SALE EXCEEDED THE LAND’S FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, WHICH RESULTED IN RECOGNITION OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS.  DUE TO THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON THE LAND HELD FOR SALE, THE COMPANY UPDATED ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR OTHER LAND OWNED, BUT NOT HELD FOR SALE, IN COLORADO SPRINGS AND DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF SOME OF THIS OTHER LAND EXCEEDED SUCH LAND’S ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, WHICH RESULTED IN RECOGNITION OF AN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT LOSS; AND•$6.6 MILLION ON LAND IN ABERDEEN, MARYLAND.  AFTER CONCLUDING DURING THE PERIOD THAT IT NO LONGER EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OPERATING PROPERTIES ON THE LAND, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LAND WOULD NOT LIKELY BE RECOVERED FROM THE SALE OF THIS LAND OVER THE LIKELY REMAINING HOLDING PERIOD.  ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ADJUSTED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LAND TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED GUIDANCE FOR:•FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY, OF BETWEEN $0.51 AND $0.53 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND BETWEEN $2.00 AND $2.02 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015;•FFOPS OF BETWEEN $0.50 AND $0.52 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND BETWEEN $2.74 AND $2.76 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015; AND•DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) OF BETWEEN $0.52 AND $0.54 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND BETWEEN $1.67 AND $1.69 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015.THE COMPANY HAS MODIFIED ITS GUIDANCE AS FOLLOWS:•THE COMPANY IS AFFIRMING ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED GUIDANCE FOR FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY;•FFOPS IS MODIFIED TO BETWEEN $0.30 AND $0.32 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND BETWEEN $2.54 AND $2.56 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015; AND•DILUTED EPS IS MODIFIED TO BETWEEN $0.58 AND $0.60 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND BETWEEN $1.73 AND $1.75 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015.RISK FACTOR - RESULTS REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS GUIDANCE MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED. THE MODIFIED GUIDANCE DISCLOSED IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K IS BASED UPON A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SUFFICIENTLY SPECIFIC AND ARE REASONABLE, THEY ARE NEVERTHELESS SUBJECT TO BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE UNCERTAINTIES.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY’S ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES.  IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SET FORTH IN OUR PERIODIC FILINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”).  RECONCILIATIONS OF PROJECTED DILUTED EPS TO PROJECTED FFOPS FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 ARE PROVIDED AS FOLLOWS: THREE MONTHS ENDED YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 DECEMBER 31, 2015 LOW HIGH LOW HIGHEPS$0.58 $0.60 $1.73 $1.75REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION0.37 0.37 1.43 1.43GAINS ON SALES OF PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED PROPERTIES(0.65) (0.65) (0.65) (0.65)IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED PROPERTIES— — 0.03 0.03FFOPS, NAREIT DEFINITION0.30 0.32 2.54 2.56IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON UNDEPRECIATED PROPERTIES0.21 0.21 0.21 0.21OPERATING PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS— — 0.04 0.04DEMOLITION COSTS ON REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES— — 0.02 0.02NOI FROM PROPERTIES TRANSFERRED (A)— — (0.01) (0.01)INTEREST EXPENSE ON LOAN SECURED BY THE PROPERTIES TRANSFERRED (A)— — 0.11 0.11GAINS ON SALES OF UNDEPRECIATED PROPERTIES— — (0.04) (0.04)NET GAINS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT (B)— — (0.87) (0.87)FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY$0.51 $0.53 $2.00 $2.02        A.IN THE THIRD QUARTER, THE COMPANY TRANSFERRED TWO OPERATING PROPERTIES IN SATISFACTION OF NON-RECOURSE SECURED INDEBTEDNESS. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE COMPANY'S NET OPERATING INCOME GENERATED BY THESE ASSETS AND INTEREST EXPENSE (ACCRUED AT THE DEFAULT RATE) IN 2015 THROUGH THE AUGUST 28, 2015 TRANSFER DATE.B.REPRESENTS DEBT AND ACCRUED INTEREST IN EXCESS OF THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS TRANSFERRED.THE COMPANY USES THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DESCRIBED BELOW IN EARNINGS PRESS RELEASES AND INFORMATION FURNISHED TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE MEASURES ARE HELPFUL TO INVESTORS IN MEASURING ITS PERFORMANCE AND COMPARING SUCH PERFORMANCE TO OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (“REITS”).  SINCE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS INCLUDABLE IN NET INCOME, RELIANCE ON THE MEASURES HAS LIMITATIONS; MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY USING THE MEASURES SIMPLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ARE WEIGHED IN BALANCE WITH OTHER GAAP AND NON-GAAP MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIONS OF THE COMPANY’S CASH FLOW AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH NEEDS.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR PAY DEBT SERVICE.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (“FFO” OR “FFO PER NAREIT”) DEFINED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) COMPUTED USING GAAP, EXCLUDING GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  WHEN MULTIPLE PROPERTIES CONSISTING OF BOTH OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING PROPERTIES EXIST ON A SINGLE TAX PARCEL, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ALL OF THE GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, THE TAX PARCEL AS ALL BEING FOR PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES WHEN MOST OF THE VALUE OF THE PARCEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING PROPERTIES ON THE PARCEL.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT USES THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST’S (“NAREIT”) DEFINITION OF FFO, ALTHOUGH OTHERS MAY INTERPRET THE DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY’S PRESENTATION OF FFO MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO IS USEFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE, BY EXCLUDING GAINS RELATED TO SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, FFO CAN HELP ONE COMPARE ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFO.BASIC FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“BASIC FFO”) THIS MEASURE IS FFO ADJUSTED TO SUBTRACT (1) PREFERRED SHARE DIVIDENDS, (2) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF PREFERRED UNITS IN CORPORATE OFFICE PROPERTIES, L.P. (THE “OPERATING PARTNERSHIP”) OR INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES NOT OWNED BY THE COMPANY, (3) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ALLOCABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES, (4) BASIC FFO ALLOCABLE TO RESTRICTED SHARES AND (5) ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS, BASIC FFO REPRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND HOLDERS OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP (“COMMON UNITS”).  COMMON UNITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE COMPANY’S COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST (“COMMON SHARES”) AND ARE EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASIC FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS DUE TO THE CLOSE CORRELATION OF COMMON UNITS TO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO BASIC FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“DILUTED FFO”) DILUTED FFO IS BASIC FFO ADJUSTED TO ADD BACK ANY CHANGES IN BASIC FFO THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE ASSUMED CONVERSION OF SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED FFO ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT IS THE NUMERATOR USED TO COMPUTE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE, DISCUSSED BELOW.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO DILUTED FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY (“DILUTED FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY”) AND FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY DEFINED AS DILUTED FFO OR FFO ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE: OPERATING PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS: GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PROPERTIES OTHER THAN PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES, NET OF ASSOCIATED INCOME TAX; GAIN OR LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; FFO ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTIES SECURING NON-RECOURSE DEBT ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DEFAULTED AND WHICH THE COMPANY HAS EXTINGUISHED, OR EXPECTS TO EXTINGUISH, VIA CONVEYANCE OF THOSE PROPERTIES (INCLUDING PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND GAINS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT); LOSS ON INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES; EXECUTIVE TRANSITION COSTS; AND ACCOUNTING CHARGES FOR ORIGINAL ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS AND, AS A RESULT, BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE ADJUSTMENT FOR FFO ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTIES SECURING NON-RECOURSE DEBT ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DEFAULTED PERTAINS TO THE PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO ITS DEFAULT ON THE LOAN’S PAYMENT TERMS, WHICH IS THE RESULT OF ITS DECISION TO NOT SUPPORT PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN.  WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUES AS THE LEGAL OWNER OF THE PROPERTIES DURING THIS PERIOD, ALL CASH FLOWS PRODUCED BY THE PROPERTIES GO DIRECTLY TO THE LENDER AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT FUND ANY DEBT SERVICE SHORTFALLS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE.DILUTED FFO PER SHARE (“FFOPS”)FFOPS IS (1) DILUTED FFO DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE COMPUTATION OF FFOPS ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFOPS IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH A FURTHER CONTEXT FOR EVALUATING OUR FFO RESULTS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT INVESTORS USE EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) IN EVALUATING NET (LOSS) INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFOPS.FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITYDEFINED AS (1) DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE COMPUTATION OF THIS MEASURE ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE THE PER SHARE MEASURE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS.  AS SUCH, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE.NET OPERATING INCOME (“NOI”) FROM REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS NOI IS REAL ESTATE REVENUES FROM CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS REDUCED BY TOTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; TOTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES, AS USED IN THIS DEFINITION, DO NOT INCLUDE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION OR INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NOI IS AN IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR A REIT’S OPERATING REAL ESTATE BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MEASURE OF THE CORE REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS THAT IS UNAFFECTED BY DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, FINANCING AND GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEASING EXPENSES; THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS, SAME-OFFICE PROPERTY GROUPINGS AND INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO NOI.FORWARD‑LOOKING STATEMENTSTHIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K CONTAINS “FORWARD‑LOOKING” STATEMENTS, WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND SECTION 21E OF THE EXCHANGE ACT THAT ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY’S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND FINANCIAL TRENDS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS BUSINESS.

STOCK UNITS WITH RESPECT TO OMEGA’S COMMON STOCK (“PRSUS”) AND PERFORMANCE-BASED LIMITED PARTNERSHIP UNITS

PERIOD COMMENCING JANUARY 1, 2016. THE LTIP UNITS PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A NUMBER OF LTIP UNITS IN OMEGA OP OVER THE SAME
THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

RSUS WILL BE PAID IN OMEGA COMMON STOCK UPON VESTING.
 
PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS. EACH EXECUTIVE
OFFICER’S 2016 PRSU AWARD WILL BE EARNED BASED ON THE LEVEL OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (“TSR”)
PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE FTSE NAREIT EQUITY HEALTH CARE INDEX (“RELATIVE TSR”) ACHIEVED OVER THE THREE-YEAR
PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018, AS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW:

THE BASELINE STOCK PRICE FROM WHICH RELATIVE TSR WILL BE MEASURED
OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018 IS $33.81, THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE PER SHARE OF OMEGA COMMON
STOCK FOR NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2015. FOR THE 2016 GRANTS, RELATIVE TSR MEANS OMEGA’S
TSR AS COMPARED TO THE TSR FOR THE FTSE NAREIT EQUITY HEALTH CARE INDEX FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. (UNDER THE OUTSTANDING GRANTS
MADE IN 2015, RELATIVE TSR IS MEASURED BY REFERENCE TO THE MSCI U.S. REIT INDEX.) IF THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF RELATIVE TSR FALLS BETWEEN
THRESHOLD AND TARGET OR BETWEEN TARGET AND HIGH, THE NUMBER OF UNITS EARNED WILL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH A SEPARATE WRITTEN
INTERPOLATION METHODOLOGY PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED BY OMEGA IN CONNECTION WITH VALUING THE UNITS. IN THE EVENT THAT OMEGA’S
ACTUAL RELATIVE TSR PERFORMANCE DOES NOT MEET THE THRESHOLD REQUIREMENT, NO PRSUS WILL BE EARNED. IF OMEGA’S ACTUAL RELATIVE
TSR PERFORMANCE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD IS ABOVE THE HIGH PERFORMANCE LEVEL, THE NUMBER OF PRSUS EARNED WILL BE AT THE HIGH
PERFORMANCE LEVEL.
 
THE PRSU AWARDS GRANTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE EFFECTIVE
AS OF MARCH 17, 2016 ALLOW THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TO EARN A NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, AS SHOWN IN THE APPLICABLE COLUMN

THE NUMBER OF SHARES EARNED UNDER THE PRSUS WILL BE DETERMINED AS
OF THE LAST DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDS AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, UNLESS A CHANGE IN CONTROL OCCURS
BEFORE THEN. 25% OF THE EARNED PRSUS WILL VEST ON THE LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER IN 2019, SUBJECT TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S
CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT ON THE VESTING DATE, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A QUALIFYING TERMINATION. IF THE QUALIFYING TERMINATION IS NOT
IN CONNECTION WITH A CHANGE IN CONTROL, VESTING WILL BE PRORATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS ELAPSED IN THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD
THROUGH THE DATE OF THE QUALIFYING TERMINATION OR WILL BE ACCELERATED 100% IF THE QUALIFYING TERMINATION OCCURS ON OR AFTER DECEMBER
31, 2018. IF A CHANGE IN CONTROL OCCURS DURING THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD WILL END ON THE DATE OF
THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. IF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS EMPLOYED ON THE DATE OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL OR HAS A QUALIFYING TERMINATION
IN CONNECTION WITH A CHANGE IN CONTROL, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF RELATIVE TSR AS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL, ALL, A
PORTION, OR NONE OF THE PRSUS WILL BE EARNED AND VESTED ON THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.
 
THE EARNED AND VESTED PRSUS WILL BE PAID IN OMEGA COMMON STOCK WITHIN
TEN DAYS FOLLOWING EACH VESTING DATE OR ON THE DATE OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL, IF EARLIER.
 
DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAYABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON AND AFTER
JANUARY 1, 2016 ACCRUE ON PRSUS THAT ARE SUBSEQUENTLY EARNED AT THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. ACCRUED DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS
WILL BE PAID TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITHIN TEN DAYS FOLLOWING THE LAST DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS
EARNED THEREAFTER ON THE EARNED AND UNVESTED PRSUS WILL BE PAID CURRENTLY.
 
LTIP UNITS. LTIP UNITS ARE EARNED BASED ON OMEGA’S
ABSOLUTE TSR PERFORMANCE. LTIP UNITS THAT BECOME EARNED AND VESTED ARE CONVERTIBLE ON ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS INTO LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
UNITS IN OMEGA OP (“OMEGA OP UNITS”), WHICH IN TURN CAN GENERALLY BE REDEEMED FOR CASH OR OMEGA COMMON STOCK
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF OMEGA OP.
 
THE NUMBER OF LTIP UNITS EARNED (“EARNED LTIP UNITS”)
BY EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE LEVEL OF ABSOLUTE TSR ACHIEVED OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDING

OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018 IS $33.81, THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE PER SHARE OF OMEGA COMMON
STOCK FOR NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2015. OMEGA’S ACTUAL ABSOLUTE TSR IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE
TO THE ANNUALIZED CHANGE IN OMEGA’S COMMON STOCK PRICE PER SHARE OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD INCLUDING THE REINVESTMENT OF
DIVIDENDS DECLARED DURING THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. IF THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF ABSOLUTE TSR FALLS BETWEEN THRESHOLD AND TARGET OR BETWEEN
TARGET AND HIGH, THE NUMBER OF UNITS EARNED WILL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH A SEPARATE WRITTEN INTERPOLATION METHODOLOGY
PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED BY OMEGA IN CONNECTION WITH VALUING THE UNITS. IN THE EVENT THAT OMEGA’S ACTUAL ABSOLUTE TSR PERFORMANCE
DOES NOT MEET THE THRESHOLD REQUIREMENT, NO LTIP UNITS WILL BE EARNED. IF OMEGA’S ACTUAL ABSOLUTE TSR PERFORMANCE FOR THE
PERFORMANCE PERIOD IS ABOVE THE HIGH PERFORMANCE LEVEL, THE NUMBER OF LTIP UNITS EARNED WILL BE AT THE HIGH PERFORMANCE LEVEL.
 
ALL LTIP UNITS THAT HAVE NOT BECOME EARNED LTIP UNITS AS OF THE
LAST DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD ARE FORFEITED AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD.
 
THE LTIP UNIT AWARDS GRANTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE EFFECTIVE

ON THE VESTING DATE, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A QUALIFYING TERMINATION. IF THE QUALIFYING TERMINATION IS NOT IN CONNECTION WITH A
CHANGE IN CONTROL, VESTING WILL BE PRORATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS ELAPSED IN THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD THROUGH THE DATE OF THE
QUALIFYING TERMINATION OR WILL BE ACCELERATED 100% IF THE QUALIFYING TERMINATION OCCURS ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2018. IF A CHANGE

ARE EARNED, THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER HOLDING SUCH LTIP UNITS WILL RECEIVE A DISTRIBUTION FROM OMEGA OP PER EARNED LTIP UNIT (AND A
CORRESPONDING ALLOCATION OF NET INCOME AND NET LOSS PER EARNED LTIP UNIT) EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF: (I) THE AMOUNT OF DISTRIBUTIONS
FROM OMEGA OP THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PAID PER LTIP UNIT IF THE LTIP UNIT HAD BEEN AN OMEGA OP UNIT ON JANUARY 1, 2016 OVER (II) THE
TOTAL AMOUNT OF INTERIM DISTRIBUTION PER LTIP UNIT RECEIVED DURING THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD.
 
IN ADDITION, WITH RESPECT TO DISTRIBUTIONS AND ALLOCATIONS OF NET
INCOME AND NET LOSS THAT ACCRUE FOLLOWING THE DATE THAT ANY LTIP UNITS BECOME A EARNED LTIP UNIT, WHETHER VESTED OR UNVESTED, THE

AT A MEETING HELD ON MARCH 16, 2016, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE COMMITTEE) OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES (THE BOARD) OF LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST (THE COMPANY) APPROVED AWARDS (THE 2016 AWARDS) UNDER THE LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST 2008 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, AS RESTATED AND AMENDED IN 2014 (THE 2008 PLAN), WITH THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. THE 2016 AWARDS, DESCRIBED BELOW IN MORE DETAIL, PROVIDE FOR AN AGGREGATE AWARD (THE AWARD) TO EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPOSED OF (I) A GRANT OF PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IN THE AMOUNT OF 65% OF THE AWARD (THE PERFORMANCE-BASED RSU COMPONENT), AND (II) A GRANT OF TIME-BASED RESTRICTED SHARES IN THE AMOUNT OF 35% OF THE AWARD (THE TIME-BASED SHARE COMPONENT).  WHEN THE COMPANYS COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST, $0.001 PAR VALUE (THE COMMON SHARES), ARE ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO THE AWARDS THEY UNDERLIE, THEY WILL BE ISSUED UNDER THE COMPANYS AMENDED AND RESTATED SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN (THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN), AND SHALL GENERALLY BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THAT PLAN.
 
2016 AWARDS
 
THE 2016 AWARDS HAVE THE FOLLOWING GENERAL FEATURES:
 
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.  A RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT (RSU) UNDER THE 2008 PLAN CONSISTS OF A LEGALLY-BINDING PROMISE TO PAY THE EXECUTIVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE COMMON SHARES AT THE END OF A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD TO THE EXTENT CERTAIN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE MET OR EXCEEDED.
 
UNDER THE 2008 PLAN, THE COMMITTEE HAS THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE A WIDE VARIETY OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES ON WHICH TO BASE EACH PARTICULAR YEARS GRANT OF RSUS, AND WILL ACT EACH YEAR TO DESIGNATE THE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THAT YEAR.  FOR THE PERFORMANCE-BASED RSU COMPONENT OF THE 2016 AWARDS, THIS MEASURE IS BASED ON THE COMPANYS TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN AS COMPARED TO A DESIGNATED PEER GROUP (THE RELATIVE TSR) OVER A THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD (THE AWARD PERIOD).
 
THE COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED A PERFORMANCE METRICS SCHEDULE FOR THE PERFORMANCE-BASED RSU COMPONENT OF THE 2016 AWARDS, LISTING THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH THE RSUS WILL BE EARNED, IN RELATION TO THE SPECIFIED TARGET LEVELS OF RELATIVE TSR PERFORMANCE OVER THE THREE-YEAR AWARD PERIOD.  THESE LEVELS PROVIDE FOR SPECIFIED AWARDS UPON ATTAINMENT OF STIPULATED PERCENTAGES OF THE TARGET LEVEL, WITH THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES PAYABLE EQUAL TO 200% (272% FOR OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER) OF THE TARGETED NUMBER OF RSUS GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2016 AWARDS, WITH THE COMMITTEE RETAINING DISCRETION TO REDUCE THE AWARD FROM THE PRESCRIBED LEVEL AS IT DEEMS FIT. ANY DIVIDENDS THAT ACCUMULATE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD WILL BE PAID IF AND WHEN THE RELATED RSUS ARE EARNED AND PAID, IN AN AMOUNT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES ACTUALLY EARNED AND PAID.
 
IF A RECIPIENT OF AN AWARD QUITS OR IS DISCHARGED FOR CAUSE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD, ALL RSUS WILL BE FORFEITED. IF THE RECIPIENT OF AN AWARD INSTEAD TERMINATES BY REASON OF DEATH, DISABILITY OR RETIREMENT (AS DEFINED IN THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN) PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD, THE TREATMENT OF THE RSUS SHALL BE AS SET FORTH IN THE GRANT DOCUMENTS.  THE RSUS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EARLY VESTING PURSUANT TO THE COMPANYS SENIOR OFFICER SEVERANCE PLAN (THE SEVERANCE PLAN).  THE 2008 PLAN ALSO INCLUDES SEVERAL COMMON CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUBJECT TO THE COMMITTEES DISCRETION, THAT WOULD TRIGGER FORFEITURE OF THE RSUS.
 
1





 
RESTRICTED SHARES.  A RESTRICTED SHARE UNDER THE 2008 PLAN CONSISTS OF THE GRANT OF COMMON SHARES TO THE EXECUTIVES WHICH ARE ELIGIBLE TO VEST ON THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE. DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, THE RECIPIENT OF THE AWARD IS ENTITLED TO VOTE WITH RESPECT TO THE RESTRICTED SHARES AND WILL RECEIVE DIVIDENDS CURRENTLY.
 
IF A RECIPIENT OF AN AWARD QUITS OR IS DISCHARGED FOR CAUSE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD, ALL RESTRICTED SHARES WILL BE FORFEITED. IF THE RECIPIENT OF AN AWARD INSTEAD TERMINATES BY REASON OF DEATH, DISABILITY OR RETIREMENT PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD, THE TREATMENT OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES SHALL BE AS SET FORTH IN THE GRANT DOCUMENTS.  THE RESTRICTED SHARES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EARLY VESTING PURSUANT TO THE SEVERANCE PLAN.  THE 2008 PLAN ALSO INCLUDES SEVERAL COMMON CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUBJECT TO THE COMMITTEES DISCRETION, THAT WOULD TRIGGER FORFEITURE OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES.

(I) FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO) PER SHARE (USING THE NAREIT DEFINITION), AS FFO MAY BE ADJUSTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IN ITS DISCRETION TO EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS, (II) SAME STORE NET
OPERATING INCOME (SS NOI) GROWTH, (III) FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO AND (IV) DISCRETIONARY OBJECTIVES (BASED ON FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL GOALS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER). THE COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE HAS ASSIGNED WEIGHTING FACTORS TO EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES, SUCH THAT PERFORMANCE IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES WILL HAVE A MORE PRONOUNCED IMPACT ON THE BONUS POOL UNDER THE 2016 EMPLOYEE BONUS PLAN THAN WILL PERFORMANCE IN OTHER
CATEGORIES. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS ASSIGNED A 65% WEIGHTING FACTOR TO THE FFO PER SHARE CATEGORY, A 10% WEIGHTING FACTOR TO EACH OF THE SS NOI GROWTH AND FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO CATEGORIES, AND A 15% WEIGHTING FACTOR TO THE DISCRETIONARY
OBJECTIVES CATEGORY.  THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS ALSO ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE TARGETS AND THRESHOLDS RELATING TO EACH PERFORMANCE
CATEGORY. ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS WITH RESPECT TO EACH PERFORMANCE CATEGORY WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE INCENTIVE POOL FROM WHICH AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE 2016 EMPLOYEE BONUS PLAN. ACHIEVEMENT BY THE COMPANY OF SPECIFICALLY
IDENTIFIED LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO EACH PERFORMANCE CATEGORY WILL RESULT IN FUNDING OF THE INCENTIVE POOL FOR THE 2016 EMPLOYEE BONUS PLAN OF 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% OR 125%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE BONUS OPPORTUNITY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT
PERFORMANCE CATEGORY. SHOULD PERFORMANCE FALL BETWEEN TWO IDENTIFIED PAYOUT LEVELS, THE RESULTING COMPENSATION THAT MAY BE EARNED FOR SUCH PERFORMANCE WILL BE PRORATED BASED ON LINEAR INTERPOLATION.

WE HAVE ANNOUNCED THE FOLLOWING UPDATES:
 
·                  THE INCENTIVE FEE PAYABLE UNDER OUR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE RMR GROUP LLC, OR RMR LLC, FOR 2015 IS $62.3 MILLION AND IS PAYABLE IN CASH BY JANUARY 30, 2016. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2015, WE HAD RECORDED $17.4 MILLION OF ESTIMATED INCENTIVE FEES. WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE AN ADDITIONAL $44.9 MILLION OF INCENTIVE FEE EXPENSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015 TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL INCENTIVE FEES DUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015.
 
UNDER OUR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE MAY BE EARNED BY RMR LLC FOR AN ANNUAL PERIOD IN AN AMOUNT, SUBJECT TO A CAP BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST, $.01 PAR VALUE, OR OUR COMMON SHARES, EQUAL TO 12% OF THE PRODUCT OF (A) OUR EQUITY MARKET CAPITALIZATION ON THE LAST TRADING DAY ON THE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND (B) THE AMOUNT (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) BY WHICH THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE REALIZED BY THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON SHARES (I.E., SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION PLUS DIVIDENDS) EXCEEDS THE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE SNL US REIT HOTEL INDEX FOR THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT PERIOD.
 
·                  IN DECEMBER 2015, WE DISTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK OF THE RMR GROUP INC., OR RMR INC., TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. ON THE DISTRIBUTION DATE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RMR INC. CLASS A COMMON STOCK WAS $26.51 PER SHARE AND THE MARKET VALUE WAS $11.89 PER SHARE (BASED ON THE CLOSING PRICE PER RMR INC. CLASS A COMMON SHARE ON THE DISTRIBUTION DATE).  AS A RESULT OF THE MARKET VALUE OF RMR INC.S CLASS A COMMON STOCK BEING LOWER THAN OUR CARRYING VALUE PER RMR INC. SHARE ON THE DISTRIBUTION DATE, WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE A NON-CASH LOSS ON THIS DISTRIBUTION UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OF APPROXIMATELY $36.8 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015.  SINCE THE DISTRIBUTION DATE, THE TRADING PRICE OF RMR INC.S CLASS A COMMON STOCK HAS INCREASED TO $19.20 PER SHARE (BASED ON THE CLOSING PRICE PER RMR INC. CLASS A COMMON SHARE ON JANUARY 15, 2016).  IF THE TRADING PRICE OF RMR INC.S CLASS A COMMON STOCK ON THE DISTRIBUTION DATE HAD BEEN AT THE INCREASED PRICE OF $19.20 PER SHARE, WE WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED A SMALLER NON-CASH LOSS ON THE DISTRIBUTION.
 
·                  IN JANUARY 2016, WE AGREED TO ACQUIRE A FULL SERVICE HOTEL WITH 221 ROOMS LOCATED IN PORTLAND, OREGON FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $114.0 MILLION, EXCLUDING CLOSING COSTS. WE PLAN TO ADD THIS HOTEL TO OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP, PLC. WE EXPECT TO FUND THIS ACQUISITION USING CASH ON HAND AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE CLOSING OF THIS ACQUISITION IS CONTINGENT UPON COMPLETION OF OUR DILIGENCE AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS; ACCORDINGLY, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL PURCHASE THIS PROPERTY OR, IF WE PURCHASE THIS PROPERTY, IT WILL BE ON THE TERMS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED.

AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY’S ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES.  IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SET FORTH IN OUR PERIODIC FILINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”).  RECONCILIATIONS OF PROJECTED DILUTED EPS TO PROJECTED FFOPS AND FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING JUNE 30, 2016 AND YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2016 ARE PROVIDED AS FOLLOWS: THREE MONTHS ENDING YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2016 DECEMBER 31, 2016 LOW HIGH LOW HIGHEPS$0.08 $0.10 $0.38 $0.48REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION0.40 0.40 1.60 1.60IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON OPERATING PROPERTIES— — 0.01 0.01GAINS ON SALES OF OPERATING PROPERTIES— — (0.10) (0.10)FFOPS, NAREIT DEFINITION0.48 0.50 1.89 1.99EXECUTIVE TRANSITION COSTS— — 0.04 0.04IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON NON-OPERATING PROPERTIES— — 0.02 0.02FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY$0.48 $0.50 $1.95 $2.05        THE COMPANY USES THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DESCRIBED BELOW IN EARNINGS PRESS RELEASES AND INFORMATION FURNISHED TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE MEASURES ARE HELPFUL TO INVESTORS IN MEASURING ITS PERFORMANCE AND COMPARING SUCH PERFORMANCE TO OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (“REITS”).  SINCE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS INCLUDABLE IN NET INCOME, RELIANCE ON THE MEASURES HAS LIMITATIONS; MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY USING THE MEASURES SIMPLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ARE WEIGHED IN BALANCE WITH OTHER GAAP AND NON-GAAP MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIONS OF THE COMPANY’S CASH FLOW AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH NEEDS.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR PAY DEBT SERVICE.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (“FFO” OR “FFO PER NAREIT”) DEFINED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) COMPUTED USING GAAP, EXCLUDING GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  WHEN MULTIPLE PROPERTIES CONSISTING OF BOTH OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING PROPERTIES EXIST ON A SINGLE TAX PARCEL, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ALL OF THE GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, THE TAX PARCEL AS ALL BEING FOR PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES WHEN MOST OF THE VALUE OF THE PARCEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING PROPERTIES ON THE PARCEL.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT USES THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST’S (“NAREIT”) DEFINITION OF FFO, ALTHOUGH OTHERS MAY INTERPRET THE DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY’S PRESENTATION OF FFO MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO IS USEFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE, BY EXCLUDING GAINS RELATED TO SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, FFO CAN HELP ONE COMPARE ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFO.BASIC FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“BASIC FFO”) THIS MEASURE IS FFO ADJUSTED TO SUBTRACT (1) PREFERRED SHARE DIVIDENDS, (2) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF PREFERRED UNITS IN CORPORATE OFFICE PROPERTIES, L.P. (THE “OPERATING PARTNERSHIP”) OR INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES NOT OWNED BY THE COMPANY, (3) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ALLOCABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES, (4) BASIC FFO ALLOCABLE TO RESTRICTED SHARES AND (5) ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS, BASIC FFO REPRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND HOLDERS OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP (“COMMON UNITS”).  COMMON UNITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE COMPANY’S COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST (“COMMON SHARES”) AND ARE EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASIC FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS DUE TO THE CLOSE CORRELATION OF COMMON UNITS TO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO BASIC FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“DILUTED FFO”) DILUTED FFO IS BASIC FFO ADJUSTED TO ADD BACK ANY CHANGES IN BASIC FFO THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE ASSUMED CONVERSION OF SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED FFO ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT IS THE NUMERATOR USED TO COMPUTE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE, DISCUSSED BELOW.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO DILUTED FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY (“DILUTED FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY”) AND FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY DEFINED AS DILUTED FFO OR FFO ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE: OPERATING PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS: GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PROPERTIES OTHER THAN PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES, NET OF ASSOCIATED INCOME TAX; GAIN OR LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; FFO ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTIES SECURING NON-RECOURSE DEBT ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DEFAULTED AND WHICH THE COMPANY HAS EXTINGUISHED, OR EXPECTS TO EXTINGUISH, VIA CONVEYANCE OF THOSE PROPERTIES (INCLUDING PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND GAINS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT); LOSS ON INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES; EXECUTIVE TRANSITION COSTS; AND ACCOUNTING CHARGES FOR ORIGINAL ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF OUR BASIC OPERATIONS AND, AS A RESULT, BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE ADJUSTMENT FOR FFO ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTIES SECURING NON-RECOURSE DEBT ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DEFAULTED PERTAINS TO THE PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO ITS DEFAULT ON THE LOAN’S PAYMENT TERMS, WHICH IS THE RESULT OF ITS DECISION TO NOT SUPPORT PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN.  WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUES AS THE LEGAL OWNER OF THE PROPERTIES DURING THIS PERIOD, ALL CASH FLOWS PRODUCED BY THE PROPERTIES GO DIRECTLY TO THE LENDER AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT FUND ANY DEBT SERVICE SHORTFALLS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE.DILUTED FFO PER SHARE (“FFOPS”)FFOPS IS (1) DILUTED FFO DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE COMPUTATION OF FFOPS ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFOPS IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH A FURTHER CONTEXT FOR EVALUATING OUR FFO RESULTS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT INVESTORS USE EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) IN EVALUATING NET (LOSS) INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFOPS.FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITYDEFINED AS (1) DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE COMPUTATION OF THIS MEASURE ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE THE PER SHARE MEASURE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS.  AS SUCH, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE.NET OPERATING INCOME (“NOI”) FROM REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS NOI IS REAL ESTATE REVENUES FROM CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS REDUCED BY TOTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; TOTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES, AS USED IN THIS DEFINITION, DO NOT INCLUDE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION OR INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NOI IS AN IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR A REIT’S OPERATING REAL ESTATE BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MEASURE OF THE CORE REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS THAT IS UNAFFECTED BY DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, FINANCING AND GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEASING EXPENSES; THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS, SAME-OFFICE PROPERTY GROUPINGS AND INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO NOI.FORWARD‑LOOKING STATEMENTSTHIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K CONTAINS “FORWARD‑LOOKING” STATEMENTS, WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND SECTION 21E OF THE EXCHANGE ACT THAT ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY’S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND FINANCIAL TRENDS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS BUSINESS.

IN APRIL 2016, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 46,637 SQUARE FOOT MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDING IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $21.6 MILLION.
THE PROPERTY IS LOCATED ON THE CAMPUS OF UW MEDICINES VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER, A 321 BED MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HOSPITAL. IN MAY 2016, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 63,012 SQUARE FOOT MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDING IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA FOR A PURCHASE
PRICE OF $19.8 MILLION, INCLUDING $13.2 MILLION IN ASSUMED MORTGAGE DEBT. THIS PROPERTY IS ON THE CAMPUS OF HCAS WEST HILLS HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL CENTER, A 225 BED MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HOSPITAL. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT FOR THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ON-CAMPUS, MULTI-TENANT MEDICAL OFFICE FACILITIES WITH MARKET LEADING HOSPITALS THAT MEET OUR INVESTMENT CRITERIA. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES COMPLETING ACQUISITIONS OF $150 MILLION OR MORE OVER THE
COURSE OF THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AT AN AVERAGE FIRST YEAR CASH CAPITALIZATION RATE OF 5.5% TO 5.75%, IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE, INCLUDING SEATTLE, LOS ANGELES, AND WASHINGTON D.C./BALTIMORE. THE COMPANY
ALSO EXPECTS TO INVEST $85 MILLION IN MEDICAL OFFICE DEVELOPMENT AND RE-DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, AT TARGETED STABILIZED YIELDS RANGING FROM 6.75% TO 8.5%. FOUR SUCH PROJECTS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY IN




AUSTIN, BIRMINGHAM, DENVER, AND NASHVILLE WITH LEASES IN PLACE OF 79% OF SQUARE FOOTAGE AND APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION REMAINING TO SPEND. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES STARTING TWO ADDITIONAL PROJECTS
IN THE SEATTLE AREA WITH TOTAL BUDGETS OF $70 MILLION, EXPECTED PRE-LEASING OF MORE THAN 50% OF SQUARE FOOTAGE, WITH $35 MILLION ESTIMATED TO BE SPENT OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PROPERTIES IS EXPECTED TO
ENHANCE OUR INTERNAL GROWTH PROSPECTS. THE ACQUISITIONS AND THE SEATTLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE SUBJECT TO EXECUTION OF DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS, CUSTOMARY DUE DILIGENCE AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CONDITIONS. THERE CAN BE NO
ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACQUIRE ANY OF THESE PROPERTIES OR COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PROJECTS.  AT-THE-MARKET EQUITY OFFERING

THE COMPANY AND ITS OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, LIBERTY PROPERTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP), HAVE AGREED TO PAY MR. PAPA AN ANNUAL BASE SALARY OF $455,000.  MR. PAPA WILL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPANYS ANNUAL BONUS PLAN FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, WHICH CURRENTLY OFFERS A TARGET BONUS OF 85% OF ANNUAL BASE SALARY FOR MR.

THE VALUE OF THIS SEPARATE GRANT WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $379,345.  DIVIDENDS WILL BE PAID CURRENTLY, THROUGH PAYROLL, ON SUCH UNVESTED STOCK.  THIS STOCK WILL VEST ON APPROXIMATELY THE SAME VESTING SCHEDULE OF THE FORFEITED UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AND OPTIONS OF THE PRIOR EMPLOYER.
 
THE PARTIES HAVE ALSO AGREED THAT SHOULD MR. PAPAS EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY END, ON OR BEFORE JULY 1, 2019, DUE TO MUTUAL AGREEMENT FOR REASONS OTHER THAN (I) CAUSE, (II) MR. PAPAS VOLUNTARY RESIGNATION OR (III) A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, THEN CONTINGENT UPON MR. PAPA SIGNING A RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS INCLUDING NON-COMPETE AND NON-SOLICITATION PROVISIONS, MR. PAPA WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CERTAIN PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS, DEPENDING UPON WHEN THE SEPARATION OCCURRED.  SHOULD SUCH A SEPARATION OCCUR IN 2016, MR. PAPA WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE:  AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 1.5 TIMES THE SUM OF HIS ANNUAL BASE SALARY AND BONUS AT TARGET; HIS TARGET PRO-RATED BONUS FOR 2016; AND ACCELERATED VESTING FOR THE 2016 EQUITY GRANTS (I.E., THE 2016 LTI GRANT AND THE MAKE WHOLE GRANT).

PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO OFFSET IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD MR. PAPA OBTAIN OTHER EMPLOYMENT.

MS. FRAICHE AND MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY RECEIVED LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF VOTES CAST, BUT CONTINUED TO SERVE AS HOLDOVER TRUSTEES.  THEREAFTER, AT A JOINT MEETING OF THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, EACH OF MS. FRAICHE AND MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY OFFERED TO RESIGN AND RECUSED HERSELF OR HIMSELF FROM CONSIDERATION OF DECISIONS REGARDING HER OR HIS CONTINUED SERVICE AS A TRUSTEE.  THEREAFTER, THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES DETERMINED TO DECLINE EACH OF THE OFFERS TO RESIGN AND THAT MS. FRAICHE AND MR. LAMKIN SHOULD CONTINUE AS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES AND MR. ADAM PORTNOY AS A MANAGING TRUSTEE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS, AMONG OTHERS:
 
·                  THE COMPANYS BOARD OF TRUSTEES IS COMPOSED OF THREE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES AND TWO MANAGING TRUSTEES.  APPLICABLE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE RULES REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY HAVE AN AUDIT COMMITTEE EXCLUSIVELY COMPOSED OF AT LEAST THREE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.  APPLICABLE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING REQUIREMENTS MANDATE THAT THE COMPANY HAVE A MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES AND AN AUDIT COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF AT LEAST THREE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.  THE COMPANYS GOVERNING DOCUMENTS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY HAVE AT LEAST TWO MANAGING TRUSTEES AND A MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES ON THE COMPANYS BOARD OF TRUSTEES.  BECAUSE OF THESE RULES, LISTING REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE COMPANYS GOVERNING DOCUMENTS, THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES DETERMINED TO TAKE PROMPT ACTION TO CONFIRM THE STATUS OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF TRUSTEES.
 
·                  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES CONSIDERED THE QUALITY OF THE PAST SERVICES PROVIDED BY MS. FRAICHE AND MR. LAMKIN AS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES AND BY MR. ADAM PORTNOY AS A MANAGING TRUSTEE.  THE COMPANY AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES NOTED THAT MS. FRAICHE AND MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY REGULARLY ATTENDED MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND OF THE APPLICABLE BOARD OF TRUSTEES COMMITTEES, THAT ALL OF MS. FRAICHE AND MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY WERE FULLY PREPARED FOR, AND ENGAGED IN, THOSE MEETINGS AND THAT THE ARGUMENTS, ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS PRESENTED BY MS. FRAICHE AND MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY AT THOSE MEETINGS WERE CONSIDERED BY THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO BE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS AND IN THE COMPANYS BEST INTEREST.
 
·                  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED THE BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE THAT EACH OF MS. FRAICHE AND MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY BRING TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND TO THE COMPANY, AND THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES CONCLUDED THAT THE PERSPECTIVES PROVIDED BY MS. FRAICHE AND MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND TO THE COMPANY.
 
·                  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ALSO CONSIDERED CERTAIN ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE REELECTION OF MS. FRAICHE AND MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY PRESENTED DURING THE PROXY SOLICITATION PERIOD FOR THE 2016 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS.  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE NOTED THAT UNITE HERE HAS HISTORICALLY SOLICITED VOTES AGAINST THE REELECTIONS OF THE COMPANYS NOMINEES FOR THE REASONS THAT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAD FAILED TO IMPLEMENT A PROPOSAL REGARDING OPTING OUT OF MUTA VOTED AT PRIOR ANNUAL MEETINGS, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY UNITE HERE AT THE 2016 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS.  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ALSO CONSIDERED THAT UNITE HERE IS A LABOR UNION WHICH HAS ENGAGED IN LABOR ORGANIZING CAMPAIGNS AT CERTAIN HOTELS OWNED BY THE COMPANY.  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ALSO NOTED THAT INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES, INC., OR ISS, A PROXY ADVISORY BUSINESS, HAD SUPPORTED THE UNITE HERE CAMPAIGN AND HAD ALSO ARGUED THAT MR. ADAM PORTNOY SHOULD NOT BE RE-ELECTED BECAUSE HE SERVES MORE THAN THREE PUBLIC BOARDS WHILE SERVING AS CEO OF AN OUTSIDE FIRM.  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES NOTED THAT MR. ADAM PORTNOY IS A BOARD MEMBER OF, THE CEO AND A FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE OF THE RMR GROUP LLC, OR RMR, THE COMPANYS MANAGER AND THE MANAGER OF THE OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES ON WHOSE BOARDS MR. ADAM PORTNOY SERVES.  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES NOTED THAT THE ISS ARGUMENT SEEMED TO APPLY TO A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL RULE WHICH DID NOT APPEAR TO BE APPLICABLE TO MR. ADAM PORTNOYS CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES DETERMINED THAT MR. ADAM PORTNOY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT HE HAS THE TIME FOR HIS SERVICE ON MULTIPLE BOARDS, THAT HE PROVIDED IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES DELIBERATIONS AND THAT HE WAS QUALIFIED TO SERVE AS A MANAGING TRUSTEE OF THE COMPANY.  THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES NOTED THAT ISS HAD ALSO ARGUED AGAINST THE REELECTION OF MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY BECAUSE THEY WERE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AT THE TIME THAT THE COMPANY AND RMR AMENDED THEIR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES NOTED THE THOROUGH PROCESS UNDERTAKEN BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SPECIAL COMMITTEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF THAT AMENDMENT AND THAT THE AMENDMENT HAD RESULTED IN A PROFITABLE INVESTMENT FOR THE COMPANY.
 
·                  AFTER CONSIDERING THE FOREGOING, THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES DETERMINED THAT THE HISTORY OF HIGH QUALITY SERVICES PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED BY MS. FRAICHE AND MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY OUTWEIGHED THE ARGUMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENTED AGAINST THEIR REELECTIONS AND THAT IT IS IN THE COMPANYS BEST INTEREST THAT EACH CONTINUE TO SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

IN RESPONSE TO INQUIRIES FROM THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, MS. FRAICHE AND MESSRS. LAMKIN AND ADAM PORTNOY EACH AGREED TO CONTINUE TO SERVE AS A TRUSTEE, AND EACH WILL SERVE UNTIL HER OR HIS SUCCESSOR QUALIFIES.

SIGNIFICANT TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.
 
·                  PURSUANT TO THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT, WE AND FIVE STAR ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, OR THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WHEREBY WE PURCHASED SEVEN SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES FROM FIVE STAR FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $112.4 MILLION, AND WE AND FIVE STAR SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERED INTO A NEW LONG TERM LEASE AGREEMENT, OR THE NEW LEASE, WHEREBY WE HAVE LEASED THOSE SEVEN SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES TO FIVE STAR.
 
·                  PURSUANT TO THE NEW LEASE, FIVE STAR IS REQUIRED TO PAY US ANNUAL RENT OF APPROXIMATELY $8.4 MILLION, PLUS, BEGINNING IN 2018, PERCENTAGE RENT EQUAL TO 4% OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH GROSS REVENUES, AS DEFINED IN THE NEW LEASE, OF EACH COMMUNITY EXCEEDS GROSS REVENUES OF SUCH COMMUNITY IN 2017.

ALSO PURSUANT TO THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT, WE ENTERED INTO 10 NEW POOLING AGREEMENTS WITH FIVE STAR, OR THE NEW POOLING AGREEMENTS.  NINE OF THE NEW POOLING AGREEMENTS COMBINE SIX AL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS AND ONE OF THE NEW POOLING AGREEMENTS CURRENTLY COMBINES FIVE AL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS.  EACH NEW POOLING AGREEMENT COMBINES VARIOUS CALCULATIONS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES FROM THE OPERATIONS OF THE APPLICABLE COMMUNITIES COVERED BY SUCH NEW POOLING AGREEMENT.
 
·                  PURSUANT TO THE NEW POOLING AGREEMENTS, THE AL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS COVERED BY EACH NEW POOLING AGREEMENT GENERALLY PROVIDE FIVE STAR WITH A MANAGEMENT FEE EQUAL TO EITHER 3% OR 5% OF THE GROSS REVENUES REALIZED AT SUCH COMMUNITIES PLUS REIMBURSEMENT FOR ITS DIRECT COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO SUCH COMMUNITIES, AS WELL AS AN ANNUAL INCENTIVE FEE EQUAL TO EITHER 35% OR 20% OF THE ANNUAL NET OPERATING INCOME OF SUCH COMMUNITIES REMAINING AFTER WE REALIZE AN ANNUAL MINIMUM RETURN EQUAL TO EITHER 8% OR 7% OF OUR INVESTED CAPITAL, OR, IN THE CASE OF NINE COMMUNITIES, A SPECIFIED AMOUNT PLUS 7% OF OUR INVESTED CAPITAL SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2015.

HOWEVER, WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN COMMUNITIES, OUR ANNUAL MINIMUM RETURN WAS REDUCED TO 7%, AND ALSO, WITH RESPECT TO THE NINE
 





 
COMMUNITIES REFERENCED ABOVE, OUR ANNUAL MINIMUM RETURN WAS RESET AS OF 2016 TO THE SPECIFIED AMOUNTS.

PURSUANT TO THE NEW POOLING AGREEMENTS, WE WILL PAY FIVE STAR A FEE FOR ITS MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROJECTS EQUAL TO 3% OF AMOUNTS FUNDED BY US.
 
·                  THE TERMS OF THE AL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS COVERED BY THE NEW POOLING AGREEMENTS EXPIRE BETWEEN 2030 AND 2039 AND ARE SUBJECT TO AUTOMATIC RENEWALS, UNLESS EARLIER TERMINATED OR TIMELY NOTICES OF NONRENEWAL ARE DELIVERED.  THE RIGHT THAT WE AND FIVE STAR EACH HAD UNDER THE AL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE FROM AND AFTER MAY 1, 2015 TO TERMINATE EACH SUCH AL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 WAS ELIMINATED PURSUANT TO THE APPLICABLE NEW POOLING AGREEMENT.

THE TERMS OF OUR EXISTING POOLING AGREEMENT WITH FIVE STAR THAT COMBINES OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH FIVE STAR FOR SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES THAT INCLUDE ONLY INDEPENDENT LIVING UNITS, AND THE TERMS OF THOSE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS, ALSO WERE NOT AMENDED AS PART OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  CAPELLA PORTFOLIO TRANSACTION
 ON AUGUST 31, 2015, WE ACQUIRED A PORTFOLIO OF ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS OWNED AND OPERATED BY CAPELLA HEALTHCARE, INC.
(CAPELLA) FOR A COMBINED PURCHASE PRICE AND INVESTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION. THE TRANSACTION INCLUDED OUR INVESTMENT IN SEVEN ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS (TWO OF WHICH WERE IN THE FORM OF MORTGAGE LOANS), AN ACQUISITION LOAN AND A 49%
EQUITY INTEREST IN THE ONGOING OPERATOR OF THE FACILITIES. ON OCTOBER 30, 2015, WE ACQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL IN CAMDEN, SOUTH CAROLINA OPERATED BY CAPELLA FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $25.8 MILLION. IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS ACQUISITION, WE FUNDED AN ADDITIONAL ACQUISITION LOAN TO CAPELLA OF $9.2 MILLION. AT MARCH 31, 2016, OUR ACQUISITION LOANS TO CAPELLA IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2015 CAPELLA TRANSACTIONS TOTALED $487.7 MILLION. 
ON MARCH 21, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS WITH REGIONALCARE HOSPITAL PARTNERS, INC. (REGIONALCARE), AN
AFFILIATE OF CERTAIN FUNDS MANAGED BY AFFILIATES OF APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, LLC (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, APOLLO), PURSUANT TO WHICH WE AGREED TO SELL OUR INVESTMENT IN THE OPERATIONS OF CAPELLA TO REGIONALCARE.
EFFECTIVE APRIL 30, 2016, WE COMPLETED THE DISPOSITION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE OPERATIONS OF CAPELLA (INCLUDING REPAYMENT IN FULL OF OUR ACQUISITION LOANS) FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $550 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED: (I) APPROXIMATELY

 WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OUR OWNERSHIP OF THE REAL ESTATE OF FIVE OF THE CAPELLA HOSPITALS (IN HOT SPRINGS, ARKANSAS; CAMDEN, SOUTH
CAROLINA; HARTSVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA; MUSKOGEE, OKLAHOMA; AND MCMINNVILLE, OREGON). THESE PROPERTIES (OTHER THAN THE HOT SPRINGS FACILITY) ARE SUBJECT TO A MASTER LEASE BETWEEN US AND CAPELLA THAT HAS BEEN AMENDED TO PROVIDE FOR A 13.5-YEAR TERM
WITH FOUR FIVE-YEAR EXTENSION OPTIONS, ANNUAL CONSUMER PRICE-INDEXED INCREASES, LIMITED TO A 2% FLOOR AND A 4% CEILING, AN INCREASE IN SECURITY DEPOSIT, AND THE ELIMINATION OF LESSEES PURCHASE OPTION PROVISION. THE HOT SPRINGS LEASE WAS ALSO

ARRANGEMENT ON THE OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON FACILITY, WHICH WAS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL. WE RECEIVED APPROVAL ON JUNE 1, 2016, AND THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016. THE TERMS OF THE OLYMPIA LEASE WILL BE SIMILAR TO
THE OTHER LEASES WE HAVE WITH CAPELLA. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016, WE SOLD, AT PAR VALUE, TO A LARGE INSTITUTION THE $50 MILLION UNSECURED NOTES WE PURCHASED FROM REGIONALCARE IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISPOSITION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE OPERATIONS
OF CAPELLA.

THREE OF THE FACILITIES. THIS TRANSACTION GENERATED A NET GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION.  ON MAY 20, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO A
BINDING AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY TO SELL THREE INPATIENT REHABILITATION HOSPITALS LOCATED IN TEXAS AND OPERATED BY HEALTHSOUTH. THE AGREED PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE THREE FACILITIES IS $111.5 MILLION BEFORE EXPENSES AND WILL RESULT IN A NET GAIN OF
APPROXIMATELY $45 MILLION. CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016.  ON JUNE 17, 2016, WE SOLD THE

THIS PRESS RELEASE IS INCLUDED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS REPORT AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.THE INFORMATION INCLUDED HEREIN, INCLUDING THE EXHIBIT, SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING THE PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR SUBJECT TO LIABILITIES OF THAT SECTION.  THE INFORMATION INCLUDED HEREIN, INCLUDING THE EXHIBITS, SHALL ALSO NOT BE DEEMED INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE EXCHANGE ACT REGARDLESS OF ANY GENERAL INCORPORATION LANGUAGE IN SUCH FILING.THE REGISTRANT USES THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DESCRIBED BELOW IN EARNINGS AND GUIDANCE PRESS RELEASES AND INFORMATION FURNISHED TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT THESE MEASURES ARE HELPFUL TO INVESTORS IN MEASURING ITS PERFORMANCE AND COMPARING SUCH PERFORMANCE TO OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (“REITS”).  SINCE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS INCLUDABLE IN NET INCOME, RELIANCE ON THE MEASURES HAS LIMITATIONS; MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY USING THE MEASURES SIMPLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ARE WEIGHED IN BALANCE WITH OTHER GAAP AND NON-GAAP MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIONS OF THE REGISTRANT'S CASH FLOW AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH NEEDS.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING THE REGISTRANT'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING THE REGISTRANT'S LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR PAY DEBT SERVICE.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (“FFO”)FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (“FFO”) IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME COMPUTED USING GAAP, EXCLUDING GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES, PLUS REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  WHEN MULTIPLE PROPERTIES CONSISTING OF BOTH OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING PROPERTIES EXIST ON A SINGLE TAX PARCEL, THE REGISTRANT CLASSIFIES ALL OF THE GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, THE TAX PARCEL AS ALL BEING FOR PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES WHEN MOST OF THE VALUE OF THE PARCEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING PROPERTIES ON THE PARCEL.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT IT USES THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (“NAREIT”) DEFINITION OF FFO, ALTHOUGH OTHERS MAY INTERPRET THE DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, ITS PRESENTATION OF FFO MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF OTHER REITS.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT FFO IS USEFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE, BY EXCLUDING GAINS RELATED TO SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES, NET OF RELATED TAX BENEFIT, AND EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, FFO CAN HELP ONE COMPARE ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT NET INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFO.BASIC FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“BASIC FFO”)THIS MEASURE IS FFO ADJUSTED TO SUBTRACT (1) PREFERRED SHARE DIVIDENDS, (2) ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES, (3) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF PREFERRED UNITS IN CORPORATE OFFICE PROPERTIES, LP (THE “OPERATING PARTNERSHIP”) OR INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES NOT OWNED BY THE REGISTRANT, (4) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ALLOCABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND (5) BASIC FFO ALLOCABLE TO RESTRICTED SHARES.  WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS, BASIC FFO REPRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND COMMON UNITHOLDERS.  COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON SHARES AND ARE EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT BASIC FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS DUE TO THE CLOSE CORRELATION OF COMMON UNITS TO ITS COMMON SHARES.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT NET INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO BASIC FFO.  DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“DILUTED FFO”)DILUTED FFO IS BASIC FFO ADJUSTED TO ADD BACK ANY CHANGES IN BASIC FFO THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE ASSUMED CONVERSION OF SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED FFO ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT DILUTED FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT IS THE NUMERATOR USED TO COMPUTE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE, DISCUSSED BELOW.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR FOR DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO DILUTED FFO.  DILUTED FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITYDEFINED AS DILUTED FFO ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE OPERATING PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS, GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PROPERTIES OTHER THAN PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES, NET OF ASSOCIATED INCOME TAX, GAIN OR LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, LOSS ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND ACCOUNTING CHARGES FOR ORIGINAL ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS AND, AS A RESULT, BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE.DILUTED FFO PER SHARE (“FFOPS”)FFOPS IS (1) DILUTED FFO DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT FFOPS IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH A FURTHER CONTEXT FOR EVALUATING ITS FFO RESULTS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT INVESTORS USE EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) IN EVALUATING NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS.  IN ADDITION, SINCE MOST EQUITY REITS PROVIDE FFOPS INFORMATION TO THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY, THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT FFOPS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE FOR COMPARING IT TO OTHER EQUITY REITS. THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFOPS. FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITYDEFINED AS (1) DILUTED FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE COMPUTATION OF THIS MEASURE ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE THE PER SHARE MEASURE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS.  AS SUCH, IT BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE. ITEM 9.01.

PURSUANT TO THE UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AGREED TO SELL UP TO 6,900,000 SHARES OF ITS 6.25% SERIES K CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK (THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK) IN AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING, WHICH INCLUDES AN OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION FOR UP TO 900,000 SHARES OF THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK. THE OFFERING IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE ON MARCH 15, 2013. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE OFFERING, AFTER DEDUCTING THE UNDERWRITING DISCOUNT AND OFFERING EXPENSES PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY, BUT ASSUMING NO EXERCISE OF THE OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION BY THE UNDERWRITERS, WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $145.1 MILLION. THE COMPANY MAY REDEEM THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF $25.00 PER SHARE, PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2018.THE OFFERING OF THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK WAS MADE PURSUANT TO THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 (REGISTRATION NO. 333-174880), THE PROSPECTUS DATED JUNE 14, 2011, AND THE RELATED PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT DATED MARCH 11, 2013.A COPY OF THE UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 1.1 AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.ITEM 7.01.

BECAUSE THE DIVIDEND RATE ON THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK WILL BE GREATER THAN THE INTEREST RATES PAYABLE ON THE REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT, THIS OFFERING WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS PER DILUTED SHARE AND NET INCOME ALLOCABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS PER DILUTED SHARE IN 2013. THE IMPACT OF THE $150 MILLION OFFERING, EXCLUDING ANY EXERCISE OF THE OVERALLOTMENT, ON FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS PER DILUTED SHARE AND NET INCOME ALLOCABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS PER DILUTED SHARE IN 2013 IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT $0.06 PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE.

HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF HOLDING STOCK IN THE COMPANY MAY VARY IN LIGHT OF A STOCKHOLDER'S PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AND THIS SUMMARY DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL OF THE TAX ASPECTS THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO SUCH A STOCKHOLDER. IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS ISSUES UNDER ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL TAX LAWS.    CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS, SUCH AS TAX-EXEMPT ENTITIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BROKER-DEALERS, PERSONS HOLDING THE COMPANY'S SHARES THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS, S CORPORATIONS OR OTHER PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES, FOREIGN CORPORATIONS, AND PERSONS WHO ARE NOT CITIZENS OR RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO SPECIAL RULES.  IN ADDITION, THIS DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS PARTICULAR TYPES OF STOCKHOLDERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIAL TREATMENT UNDER THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS, SUCH AS HOLDERS WHOSE SHARES OF COMPANY STOCK ARE ACQUIRED THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS OR OTHERWISE AS COMPENSATION, HOLDERS WHOSE SHARES OF COMPANY STOCK ARE ACQUIRED PURSUANT TO THE COMPANY'S DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN, AND HOLDERS WHO INTEND TO SELL THEIR SHARES OF COMPANY STOCK PURSUANT TO A SHARE REPURCHASE PLAN.  UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, THIS DISCUSSION ONLY ADDRESSES STOCKHOLDERS THAT HOLD SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AS “CAPITAL ASSETS” WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 1221 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (“CODE”).      EACH PROSPECTIVE STOCKHOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT WITH HIS OR HER OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES REGARDING THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND SALE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AND THE COMPANY'S ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A REIT, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP, SALE AND REIT ELECTION AND OF POTENTIAL CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS.    OPINION OF COUNSEL    WALLER LANSDEN DORTCH & DAVIS, LLP (“WALLER”), AS SPECIAL TAX COUNSEL TO THE COMPANY, IS OF THE OPINION THAT, COMMENCING WITH THE COMPANY'S TAXABLE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND THROUGH THE COMPANY'S TAXABLE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ORGANIZED AND OPERATED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFICATION AND TAXATION AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE, AND ITS CURRENT ORGANIZATION AND METHOD OF OPERATION HAS ENABLED IT, AND ITS PROPOSED METHOD OF OPERATION WILL CONTINUE TO ENABLE IT, TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFICATION AND TAXATION AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE FOR ITS TAXABLE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND SUBSEQUENT TAXABLE YEARS.      WALLER'S OPINION IS BASED UPON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS, IS CONDITIONED UPON THOSE ASSUMPTIONS AND CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY AS TO FACTUAL MATTERS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND THE FUTURE CONDUCT OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S QUALIFICATION FOR TAXATION AS A REIT DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO MEET THE VARIOUS QUALIFICATION TESTS IMPOSED UNDER THE CODE AS DESCRIBED BELOW.  ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS FOR ANY ONE TAXABLE YEAR WILL SATISFY SUCH REQUIREMENTS.          THE STATEMENTS IN THIS DISCUSSION AND IN THE OPINION OF WALLER ARE BASED ON RELEVANT CURRENT PROVISIONS OF THE CODE, TREASURY REGULATIONS THEREUNDER (INCLUDING PROPOSED AND TEMPORARY TREASURY REGULATIONS), AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE FOREGOING AS EXPRESSED IN COURT DECISIONS, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE RULINGS AND PRACTICES OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (THE “IRS”), INCLUDING ITS PRACTICES AND POLICIES IN ISSUING PRIVATE LETTER RULINGS, WHICH ARE NOT BINDING ON THE IRS, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO A TAXPAYER THAT RECEIVES SUCH RULING, AND ALL AS IN EFFECT AS OF THE DATE OF THIS DISCUSSION.  THE CODE, RULES, TREASURY REGULATIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS ARE ALL SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME (POSSIBLY ON A RETROACTIVE BASIS), WHICH CHANGES MAY CAUSE ANY STATEMENT CONTAINED IN THIS DISCUSSION TO BECOME INACCURATE.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY CHANGES WILL NOT MODIFY THE CONCLUSIONS EXPRESSED IN WALLER'S OPINION.  IN ADDITION, AN OPINION OF LEGAL COUNSEL IS NOT BINDING ON THE IRS, AND THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THE IRS WILL NOT SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGE THE COMPANY'S STATUS AS A REIT.        TAXATION OF THE COMPANY    THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS A REIT UNDER SECTIONS 856 THROUGH 860 OF THE CODE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS BEEN ORGANIZED AND OPERATED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFICATION AND TAXATION AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE BEGINNING WITH ITS TAXABLE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993, AND THAT ITS INTENDED MANNER OF OPERATION WILL ENABLE IT TO CONTINUE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.    IF THE COMPANY QUALIFIES AS A REIT, IT GENERALLY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON THAT PORTION OF ITS ORDINARY INCOME OR CAPITAL GAIN THAT IS CURRENTLY DISTRIBUTED TO STOCKHOLDERS.    HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX AS FOLLOWS:•THE COMPANY WILL BE TAXED AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES ON ANY UNDISTRIBUTED REIT TAXABLE INCOME, INCLUDING UNDISTRIBUTED NET CAPITAL GAINS.•UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE “ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX.”•IF THE COMPANY HAS (I) NET INCOME FROM THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF “FORECLOSURE PROPERTY” THAT IS HELD PRIMARILY FOR SALE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, OR (II) OTHER NON-QUALIFYING INCOME FROM FORECLOSURE PROPERTY, IT WILL BE SUBJECT TO TAX ON SUCH INCOME AT THE HIGHEST REGULAR CORPORATE RATE.•ANY NET INCOME THAT THE COMPANY HAS FROM PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS (WHICH ARE, IN GENERAL, CERTAIN SALES OR OTHER DISPOSITIONS OF PROPERTY, OTHER THAN FORECLOSURE PROPERTY, HELD PRIMARILY FOR SALE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS) WILL BE SUBJECT TO A 100% TAX.•IF THE COMPANY SHOULD FAIL TO SATISFY EITHER THE 75% OR 95% GROSS INCOME TEST (AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER “INCOME TESTS”), AND HAS NONETHELESS MAINTAINED ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT BECAUSE CERTAIN OTHER REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET, IT WILL BE SUBJECT TO A 100% TAX ON AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO (I) THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE COMPANY FAILS THE 75% OR 95% GROSS INCOME TEST MULTIPLIED, IN EITHER CASE, BY (II) A FRACTION, THE NUMERATOR OF WHICH IS THE REIT TAXABLE INCOME FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR (DETERMINED WITH CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS) AND THE DENOMINATOR OF WHICH IS THE GROSS INCOME FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR (WITH CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS).•IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO DISTRIBUTE DURING EACH YEAR AT LEAST THE SUM OF (I) 85% OF ITS REIT ORDINARY INCOME FOR SUCH YEAR, (II) 95% OF ITS REIT CAPITAL GAIN NET INCOME FOR SUCH YEAR, AND (III) ANY UNDISTRIBUTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM PRECEDING PERIODS, THEN THE COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO A 4% EXCISE TAX ON THE EXCESS OF SUCH REQUIRED DISTRIBUTION OVER THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTED.•IN THE EVENT OF A MORE THAN DE MINIMIS FAILURE OF ANY OF THE ASSET TESTS (AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER “ASSET TESTS”), AS LONG AS THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO REASONABLE CAUSE AND NOT TO WILLFUL NEGLECT, THE COMPANY FILES A DESCRIPTION OF EACH ASSET THAT CAUSED SUCH FAILURE WITH THE IRS, AND DISPOSES OF THE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE ASSET TESTS WITHIN SIX MONTHS AFTER THE LAST DAY OF THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES SUCH FAILURE, THE COMPANY WILL PAY A TAX EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF $50,000 OR THE HIGHEST CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE MULTIPLIED BY THE NET INCOME FROM THE NONQUALIFYING ASSETS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE COMPANY FAILED TO SATISFY THE ASSET TESTS.•IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY FAILS TO SATISFY ONE OR MORE REQUIREMENTS FOR REIT QUALIFICATION, OTHER THAN THE GROSS INCOME TESTS AND THE ASSET TESTS, AND SUCH FAILURE IS DUE TO REASONABLE CAUSE AND NOT TO WILLFUL NEGLECT, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY A PENALTY OF $50,000 FOR EACH SUCH FAILURE.•TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES GAIN FROM THE DISPOSITION OF AN ASSET WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THERE EXISTED “BUILT-IN GAIN” UPON ITS ACQUISITION BY THE COMPANY FROM A SUBCHAPTER C CORPORATION IN A CARRY-OVER BASIS TRANSACTION AND SUCH DISPOSITION OCCURS WITHIN A MAXIMUM TEN-YEAR RECOGNITION PERIOD BEGINNING ON THE DATE ON WHICH IT WAS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX AT THE HIGHEST REGULAR CORPORATE RATE ON THE AMOUNT OF ITS “NET RECOGNIZED BUILT-IN GAIN.”•TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY HAS NET INCOME FROM A TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY (“TRS”), THE TRS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX IN MUCH THE SAME MANNER AS OTHER NON-REIT SUBCHAPTER C CORPORATIONS, WITH THE EXCEPTIONS THAT THE DEDUCTIONS FOR INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEBT AND RENTAL PAYMENTS MADE BY THE TRS TO THE COMPANY WILL BE LIMITED AND AN 100% EXCISE TAX MAY BE IMPOSED ON TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE TRS AND THE COMPANY OR THE COMPANY'S TENANTS THAT ARE NOT CONDUCTED ON AN ARM'S LENGTH BASIS. A TRS IS A CORPORATION IN WHICH A REIT OWNS STOCK, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AND FOR WHICH BOTH THE REIT AND THE CORPORATION HAVE MADE TRS ELECTIONS.REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT IN ORDER FOR THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, IT MUST MEET AND CONTINUE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED BELOW RELATING TO ITS ORGANIZATION, SOURCES OF INCOME, NATURE OF ASSETS AND DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOME TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS.        IN GENERAL    THE REIT PROVISIONS OF THE CODE APPLY TO A DOMESTIC CORPORATION, TRUST, OR ASSOCIATION THAT PROPERLY ELECTS TO BE TAXED AS A REIT AND THAT ALSO:1.IS MANAGED BY ONE OR MORE TRUSTEES OR DIRECTORS;2.THE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF WHICH IS EVIDENCED BY TRANSFERABLE SHARES OR BY TRANSFERABLE CERTIFICATES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST;3.WOULD BE TAXABLE, BUT FOR SECTIONS 856 THROUGH 860 OF THE CODE, AS A DOMESTIC CORPORATION;4.IS NEITHER A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CODE;5.USES A CALENDAR YEAR FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND COMPLIES WITH APPLICABLE RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS; AND 6.MEETS THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED BELOW.OWNERSHIP TESTS    IN ORDER FOR THE COMPANY TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, COMMENCING WITH ITS SECOND TAXABLE YEAR (I) THE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF ITS STOCK MUST BE HELD BY 100 OR MORE PERSONS DURING AT LEAST 335 DAYS OF A 12-MONTH TAXABLE YEAR (OR DURING A PROPORTIONATE PART OF A TAXABLE YEAR OF LESS THAN 12 MONTHS) FOR EACH OF ITS TAXABLE YEARS AND (II) DURING THE LAST HALF OF EACH TAXABLE YEAR, NO MORE THAN 50% IN VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK MAY BE OWNED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY OR FOR FIVE OR FEWER INDIVIDUALS (THE “FIVE OR FEWER TEST”). STOCK OWNERSHIP FOR PURPOSES OF THE FIVE OR FEWER TEST IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP PROVISIONS OF SECTION 544(A) OF THE CODE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS. THE TERM “INDIVIDUAL” FOR PURPOSES OF THE FIVE OR FEWER TEST INCLUDES A PRIVATE FOUNDATION, A TRUST PROVIDING FOR THE PAYMENT OF SUPPLEMENTAL UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION BENEFITS, AND A PORTION OF A TRUST PERMANENTLY SET ASIDE OR TO BE USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES. A “QUALIFIED TRUST” DESCRIBED IN SECTION 401(A) OF THE CODE AND EXEMPT FROM TAX UNDER SECTION 501(A) OF THE CODE GENERALLY IS NOT TREATED AS AN INDIVIDUAL; RATHER, STOCK HELD BY IT IS TREATED AS OWNED PROPORTIONATELY BY ITS BENEFICIARIES.     THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS SATISFIED AND WILL CONTINUE TO SATISFY THE ABOVE OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION RESTRICTS OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFERS OF ITS STOCK THAT WOULD VIOLATE THESE REQUIREMENTS, ALTHOUGH THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES TO PREVENT A VIOLATION.  THE COMPANY WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE SATISFIED THE FIVE OR FEWER TEST FOR A PARTICULAR TAXABLE YEAR IF THE COMPANY HAS COMPLIED WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS FOR ASCERTAINING THE OWNERSHIP OF ITS OUTSTANDING STOCK IN THE TAXABLE YEAR AND HAS NO REASON TO KNOW THAT IT HAS VIOLATED THE FIVE OR FEWER TEST.INCOME TESTS    IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, TWO GROSS INCOME REQUIREMENTS MUST BE SATISFIED ANNUALLY.•FIRST, AT LEAST 75% OF THE COMPANY'S GROSS INCOME (EXCLUDING GROSS INCOME FROM CERTAIN SALES OF PROPERTY HELD AS INVENTORY OR PRIMARILY FOR SALE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, CANCELLATION OF INDEBTEDNESS INCOME, INCOME FROM CERTAIN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS) MUST BE DERIVED FROM “RENTS FROM REAL PROPERTY”; “INTEREST ON OBLIGATIONS SECURED BY MORTGAGES ON REAL PROPERTY OR ON INTERESTS IN REAL PROPERTY”; GAIN (EXCLUDING GROSS INCOME FROM CERTAIN SALES OF PROPERTY HELD AS INVENTORY OR PRIMARILY FOR SALE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS) FROM THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF, AND CERTAIN OTHER GROSS INCOME RELATED TO, REAL PROPERTY (INCLUDING INTERESTS IN REAL PROPERTY AND IN MORTGAGES ON REAL PROPERTY); AND INCOME RECEIVED OR ACCRUED WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE COMPANY'S RECEIPT OF, AND ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TEMPORARY INVESTMENT OF, “NEW CAPITAL” (ANY AMOUNT RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR STOCK OTHER THAN THROUGH A DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN OR IN A PUBLIC OFFERING OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS HAVING MATURITIES OF AT LEAST FIVE YEARS).•SECOND, AT LEAST 95% OF THE COMPANY'S GROSS INCOME (EXCLUDING GROSS INCOME FROM CERTAIN SALES OF PROPERTY HELD AS INVENTORY OR PRIMARILY FOR SALE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, CANCELLATION OF INDEBTEDNESS INCOME, INCOME FROM CERTAIN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS) MUST BE DERIVED FROM: DIVIDENDS; INTEREST; “RENTS FROM REAL PROPERTY”; GAIN (EXCLUDING GROSS INCOME FROM CERTAIN SALES OF PROPERTY HELD AS INVENTORY OR PRIMARILY FOR SALE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS) FROM THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF, AND CERTAIN OTHER GROSS INCOME RELATED TO, REAL PROPERTY (INCLUDING INTERESTS IN REAL PROPERTY AND IN MORTGAGES ON REAL PROPERTY); AND GAIN FROM THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF STOCK AND SECURITIES.    FOR AN AMOUNT RECEIVED OR ACCRUED TO QUALIFY FOR PURPOSES OF AN APPLICABLE GROSS INCOME TEST AS “RENTS FROM REAL PROPERTY” OR “INTEREST ON OBLIGATIONS SECURED BY MORTGAGES ON REAL PROPERTY OR ON INTERESTS IN REAL PROPERTY,” THE DETERMINATION OF SUCH AMOUNT MUST NOT DEPEND IN WHOLE OR IN PART ON THE INCOME OR PROFITS DERIVED BY ANY PERSON FROM SUCH PROPERTY (EXCEPT THAT SUCH AMOUNT MAY BE BASED ON A FIXED PERCENTAGE OR PERCENTAGES OF RECEIPTS OR SALES). IN ADDITION, FOR AN AMOUNT RECEIVED OR ACCRUED TO QUALIFY AS “RENTS FROM REAL PROPERTY,” SUCH AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECEIVED OR ACCRUED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM A PERSON IN WHICH THE COMPANY OWNS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY 10% OR MORE OF, IN THE CASE OF A CORPORATION, THE TOTAL VOTING POWER OF ALL VOTING STOCK OR THE TOTAL VALUE OF ALL STOCK, AND, IN THE CASE OF AN UNINCORPORATED ENTITY, THE ASSETS OR NET PROFITS OF SUCH ENTITY (EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN AMOUNTS RECEIVED OR ACCRUED FROM A TRS IN CONNECTION WITH PROPERTY SUBSTANTIALLY RENTED TO PERSONS OTHER THAN A TRS OF THE COMPANY AND OTHER 10%-OR-MORE OWNED PERSONS OR WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES, IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET).     IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MUST NOT MANAGE ITS PROPERTIES OR FURNISH OR RENDER SERVICES TO THE TENANTS OF ITS PROPERTIES, EXCEPT THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR FROM WHOM THE COMPANY DERIVES NO INCOME OR THROUGH A TRS UNLESS (I) THE COMPANY IS PERFORMING SERVICES THAT ARE USUALLY OR CUSTOMARILY FURNISHED OR RENDERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE RENTAL OF SPACE FOR OCCUPANCY ONLY AND THE SERVICES ARE OF THE SORT THAT A TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATION COULD PERFORM WITHOUT BEING CONSIDERED IN RECEIPT OF UNRELATED BUSINESS TAXABLE INCOME OR (II) THE INCOME EARNED BY THE COMPANY FOR OTHER SERVICES FURNISHED OR RENDERED BY THE COMPANY TO TENANTS OF A PROPERTY OR FOR THE MANAGEMENT OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTY DOES NOT EXCEED 1% OF THE INCOME FROM SUCH PROPERTY.    IF RENT ATTRIBUTABLE TO PERSONAL PROPERTY LEASED IN CONNECTION WITH A LEASE OF REAL PROPERTY IS GREATER THAN 15% OF THE TOTAL RENT RECEIVED UNDER THE LEASE, THEN THE PORTION OF RENT ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH PERSONAL PROPERTY WILL NOT QUALIFY AS “RENTS FROM REAL PROPERTY.” GENERALLY, THIS 15% TEST IS APPLIED SEPARATELY TO EACH LEASE. THE PORTION OF RENTAL INCOME TREATED AS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PERSONAL PROPERTY IS DETERMINED ACCORDING TO THE RATIO OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PERSONAL PROPERTY TO THE TOTAL FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY THAT IS RENTED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT FIXTURES AND OTHER PROPERTY CONSTITUTE PERSONAL PROPERTY FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES IS DIFFICULT AND IMPRECISE.    THE COMPANY LEASES AND INTENDS TO LEASE PROPERTY ONLY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH THAT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL, IF NOT ALL, RENTS FROM SUCH PROPERTY QUALIFY AS “RENTS FROM REAL PROPERTY.”    THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO HEDGING TRANSACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ONE OR MORE OF ITS ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY'S HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY INCLUDE ENTERING INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CAPS AND FLOORS, OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SUCH ITEMS, AND FUTURES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS. INCOME AND GAIN FROM “HEDGING TRANSACTIONS” WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM GROSS INCOME FOR PURPOSES OF THE 95% AND 75% GROSS INCOME TESTS. A “HEDGING TRANSACTION” INCLUDES ANY TRANSACTION ENTERED INTO IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE COMPANY'S TRADE OR BUSINESS PRIMARILY TO MANAGE THE RISK OF INTEREST RATE, PRICE CHANGES OR CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS WITH RESPECT TO BORROWINGS MADE OR TO BE MADE, OR ORDINARY OBLIGATIONS INCURRED OR TO BE INCURRED, TO ACQUIRE OR CARRY REAL ESTATE ASSETS. THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY ANY SUCH HEDGING TRANSACTION BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE DAY ON WHICH IT WAS ACQUIRED, ORIGINATED OR ENTERED INTO. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO STRUCTURE ANY HEDGING OR SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS SO AS NOT TO JEOPARDIZE ITS STATUS AS A REIT.    IF THE COMPANY WERE TO FAIL TO SATISFY ONE OR BOTH OF THE 75% OR 95% GROSS INCOME TESTS FOR ANY TAXABLE YEAR, IT MAY NEVERTHELESS QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR SUCH YEAR IF IT IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF UNDER CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CODE. THESE RELIEF PROVISIONS WOULD GENERALLY BE AVAILABLE IF (I) THE COMPANY'S FAILURE TO MEET SUCH TEST OR TESTS WAS DUE TO REASONABLE CAUSE AND NOT TO WILLFUL NEGLECT AND (II) FOLLOWING ITS IDENTIFICATION OF ITS FAILURE TO MEET THESE TESTS, THE COMPANY FILES WITH THE IRS A DESCRIPTION OF EACH ITEM OF INCOME THAT FAILS TO MEET THESE TESTS IN A SCHEDULE IN ACCORDANCE WITH TREASURY REGULATIONS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, TO KNOW WHETHER THE COMPANY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THE BENEFIT OF THESE RELIEF PROVISIONS SINCE THE APPLICATION OF THE RELIEF PROVISIONS IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. IF THESE RELIEF PROVISIONS WERE TO APPLY, THE COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO TAX EQUAL TO A PERCENTAGE TAX CALCULATED BY THE RATIO OF REIT TAXABLE INCOME TO GROSS INCOME WITH CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS MULTIPLIED BY THE GROSS INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE COMPANY FAILED EITHER OF THE 75% OR THE 95% GROSS INCOME TESTS.ASSET TESTSAT THE CLOSE OF EACH QUARTER OF ITS TAXABLE YEAR, THE COMPANY MUST ALSO SATISFY FOUR TESTS RELATING TO THE NATURE OF ITS ASSETS.•AT LEAST 75% OF THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL ASSETS MUST CONSIST OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS (INCLUDING INTERESTS IN REAL PROPERTY AND INTERESTS IN MORTGAGES ON REAL PROPERTY AS WELL AS ITS ALLOCABLE SHARE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS HELD BY JOINT VENTURES OR PARTNERSHIPS IN WHICH THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES), CASH, CASH ITEMS AND GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.•NOT MORE THAN 25% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL ASSETS MAY BE REPRESENTED BY SECURITIES OTHER THAN THOSE INCLUDABLE IN THE 75% ASSET CLASS.•NOT MORE THAN 25% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL ASSETS MAY BE REPRESENTED BY SECURITIES OF ONE OR MORE TRS.•OF THE INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE 25% ASSET CLASS, EXCEPT FOR TRS, (I) THE VALUE OF ANY ONE ISSUER'S SECURITIES OWNED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT EXCEED 5% OF THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL ASSETS AND (II) THE COMPANY MAY NOT OWN MORE THAN 10% OF ANY ONE ISSUER'S OUTSTANDING SECURITIES BY VOTE OR VALUE. FOR PURPOSES OF THESE ASSET TESTS, SECURITIES ISSUED BY AFFILIATED QUALIFIED REIT SUBSIDIARIES (“QRS”), WHICH ARE CORPORATIONS WHOLLY OWNED BY THE COMPANY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THAT ARE NOT TRS, ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE 25% OF TOTAL ASSETS LIMIT, THE 5% OF TOTAL ASSETS LIMIT OR THE 10% OF A SINGLE ISSUER'S SECURITIES LIMIT. RATHER THE EXISTENCE OF QRS IS IGNORED, AND THE ASSETS, INCOME, GAIN, LOSS AND OTHER ATTRIBUTES OF THE QRS ARE TREATED AS BEING OWNED OR GENERATED BY THE COMPANY, FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. ADDITIONALLY, “STRAIGHT DEBT” SECURITIES AND CERTAIN OTHER EXCEPTIONS ARE NOT “SECURITIES” FOR PURPOSES OF THE 10% OF A SINGLE ISSUER'S VALUE TEST.    IF THE COMPANY MEETS THE ASSET TESTS DESCRIBED ABOVE AT THE CLOSE OF ANY QUARTER, IT WILL NOT LOSE ITS STATUS AS A REIT BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN VALUE OF ITS ASSETS UNLESS THE DISCREPANCY EXISTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF ANY SECURITY OR OTHER PROPERTY THAT IS WHOLLY OR PARTLY THE RESULT OF AN ACQUISITION DURING SUCH QUARTER. WHERE A FAILURE TO SATISFY THE ASSET TESTS RESULTS FROM AN ACQUISITION OF SECURITIES OR OTHER PROPERTY DURING A QUARTER, THE FAILURE CAN BE CURED BY DISPOSITION OF SUFFICIENT NON-QUALIFYING ASSETS WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE CLOSE OF SUCH QUARTER. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ADEQUATE RECORDS OF THE VALUE OF ITS ASSETS TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ASSET TESTS AND INTENDS, IF NECESSARY, TO TAKE SUCH ACTION AS MAY BE REQUIRED TO CURE ANY FAILURE TO SATISFY THE TEST WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE CLOSE OF ANY QUARTER. NEVERTHELESS, IF THE COMPANY WERE UNABLE TO CURE WITHIN THE 30-DAY CURE PERIOD, THE COMPANY MAY CURE A VIOLATION OF THE 5% ASSET TEST OR THE 10% ASSET TEST SO LONG AS THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS CAUSING SUCH VIOLATION DOES NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF 1% OF THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL ASSETS AT THE END OF THE RELEVANT QUARTER OR $10 MILLION AND THE COMPANY DISPOSES OF THE ASSET CAUSING THE FAILURE OR OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE ASSET TESTS WITHIN SIX MONTHS AFTER THE LAST DAY OF THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE FAILURE TO SATISFY THE ASSET TEST IS DISCOVERED. FOR VIOLATIONS DUE TO REASONABLE CAUSE AND NOT DUE TO WILLFUL NEGLECT THAT ARE LARGER THAN THIS AMOUNT, THE COMPANY IS PERMITTED TO AVOID DISQUALIFICATION AS A REIT AFTER THE 30-DAY CURE PERIOD BY (I) DISPOSING OF AN AMOUNT OF ASSETS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE ASSET TESTS, (II) PAYING A TAX EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF $50,000 OR THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX RATE TIMES THE TAXABLE INCOME GENERATED BY THE NON-QUALIFYING ASSET AND (III) DISCLOSING CERTAIN INFORMATION TO THE IRS.DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTIN ORDER TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE DIVIDENDS (OTHER THAN CAPITAL GAIN DIVIDENDS) TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE EXCESS OF (A) THE SUM OF (I) 90% OF THE COMPANY'S “REIT TAXABLE INCOME” (COMPUTED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DIVIDENDS PAID DEDUCTION AND THE COMPANY'S NET CAPITAL GAIN) AND (II) 90% OF THE NET INCOME (AFTER TAX ON SUCH INCOME), IF ANY, FROM FORECLOSURE PROPERTY, OVER (B) THE SUM OF CERTAIN NON-CASH INCOME (FROM CERTAIN IMPUTED RENTAL INCOME AND INCOME FROM TRANSACTIONS INADVERTENTLY FAILING TO QUALIFY AS LIKE-KIND EXCHANGES). THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY BE WAIVED BY THE IRS IF THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES THAT IT FAILED TO MEET THEM BY REASON OF DISTRIBUTIONS PREVIOUSLY MADE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE 4% EXCISE TAX DESCRIBED BELOW. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT DISTRIBUTE ALL OF ITS NET LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAIN AND ALL OF ITS “REIT TAXABLE INCOME,” IT WILL BE SUBJECT TO TAX THEREON. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO A 4% EXCISE TAX TO THE EXTENT IT FAILS WITHIN A CALENDAR YEAR TO MAKE “REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS” TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS OF 85% OF ITS ORDINARY INCOME AND 95% OF ITS CAPITAL GAIN NET INCOME PLUS THE EXCESS, IF ANY, OF THE “GROSSED UP REQUIRED DISTRIBUTION” FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR OVER THE AMOUNT TREATED AS DISTRIBUTED FOR SUCH PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE TERM “GROSSED UP REQUIRED DISTRIBUTION” FOR ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS THE SUM OF THE TAXABLE INCOME OF THE COMPANY FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR (WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID) AND ALL AMOUNTS FROM EARLIER YEARS THAT ARE NOT TREATED AS HAVING BEEN DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE PROVISION. DIVIDENDS DECLARED IN THE LAST QUARTER OF THE YEAR AND PAID DURING THE FOLLOWING JANUARY WILL BE TREATED AS HAVING BEEN PAID AND RECEIVED ON DECEMBER 31 OF SUCH EARLIER YEAR.  THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE TIMELY DISTRIBUTIONS SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE ANNUAL DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS.UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY MAY BE ABLE TO RECTIFY A FAILURE TO MEET THE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT FOR A YEAR BY PAYING “DEFICIENCY DIVIDENDS” TO STOCKHOLDERS IN A LATER YEAR, WHICH MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID FOR THE EARLIER YEAR. THE COMPANY MAY BE ABLE TO AVOID BEING TAXED ON AMOUNTS DISTRIBUTED AS DEFICIENCY DIVIDENDS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MIGHT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES REMAIN LIABLE FOR THE 4% EXCISE TAX DESCRIBED ABOVE.RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTSTO AVOID MONETARY PENALTY, THE COMPANY MUST REQUEST ON AN ANNUAL BASIS INFORMATION FROM CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS DESIGNED TO DISCLOSE THE ACTUAL OWNERSHIP OF ITS OUTSTANDING STOCK.        FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A REITIF THE COMPANY WAS TO FAIL TO QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AS A REIT IN ANY TAXABLE YEAR, AND THE RELIEF PROVISIONS WERE FOUND NOT TO APPLY, THE COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO TAX ON ITS TAXABLE INCOME AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES (PLUS ANY APPLICABLE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX). DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS IN ANY YEAR IN WHICH THE COMPANY FAILED TO QUALIFY WOULD NOT BE DEDUCTIBLE BY THE COMPANY NOR WOULD THEY BE REQUIRED TO BE MADE. UNLESS ENTITLED TO RELIEF UNDER SPECIFIC STATUTORY PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY WOULD ALSO BE DISQUALIFIED FROM TAXATION AS A REIT FOR THE FOLLOWING FOUR TAXABLE YEARS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STATE WHETHER IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMPANY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO STATUTORY RELIEF FROM SUCH DISQUALIFICATION. FAILURE TO QUALIFY FOR EVEN ONE YEAR COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY INCURRING SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS (TO THE EXTENT BORROWINGS WERE FEASIBLE) OR LIQUIDATING SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO PAY THE RESULTING TAXES. TAXATION OF TAXABLE U.S. STOCKHOLDERSA “U.S. STOCKHOLDER” IS A HOLDER OF SHARES OF STOCK WHO, FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, IS (I) A CITIZEN OR RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, (II) A CORPORATION OR OTHER ENTITY CLASSIFIED AS A CORPORATION FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, CREATED OR ORGANIZED IN OR UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING ANY STATE, (III) AN ESTATE, THE INCOME OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE, OR (IV) A TRUST, IF, IN GENERAL, A U.S. COURT IS ABLE TO EXERCISE PRIMARY SUPERVISION OVER THE TRUST'S ADMINISTRATION AND ONE OR MORE U.S. PERSONS, WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE CODE, HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CONTROL ALL OF THE TRUST'S SUBSTANTIAL DECISIONS.IF A PARTNERSHIP HOLDS STOCK IN THE COMPANY, THE TAX TREATMENT OF A PARTNER WILL DEPEND ON THE STATUS OF THE PARTNER AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP. PARTNERS IN PARTNERSHIPS HOLDING COMPANY STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS.DISTRIBUTIONSSO LONG AS THE COMPANY QUALIFIES FOR TAXATION AS A REIT, DISTRIBUTIONS ON SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK MADE TO U.S. STOCKHOLDERS OUT OF THE CURRENT OR ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS ALLOCABLE TO THESE DISTRIBUTIONS (AND NOT DESIGNATED AS CAPITAL GAIN DIVIDENDS) WILL BE INCLUDABLE AS ORDINARY INCOME FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.  NONE OF THESE DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR CORPORATE U.S. STOCKHOLDERS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S ORDINARY DIVIDENDS WILL GENERALLY NOT QUALIFY AS QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME, WHICH, FOR INDIVIDUALS, TRUSTS AND ESTATES, IS TAXED AS NET CAPITAL GAIN. ANY DISTRIBUTION DECLARED BY THE COMPANY IN OCTOBER, NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER OF ANY YEAR ON A SPECIFIED DATE IN ANY SUCH MONTH SHALL BE TREATED AS BOTH PAID BY THE COMPANY AND RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS ON DECEMBER 31 OF THAT YEAR, PROVIDED THAT THE DISTRIBUTION IS ACTUALLY PAID BY THE COMPANY NO LATER THAN JANUARY 31 OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR.DISTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY IN EXCESS OF ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS WILL BE TREATED AS A NONTAXABLE RETURN OF CAPITAL TO THE EXTENT OF A U.S. STOCKHOLDER'S BASIS AND WILL REDUCE THE BASIS OF THE U.S. STOCKHOLDER'S SHARES. ANY DISTRIBUTIONS BY THE COMPANY IN EXCESS OF ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS AND IN EXCESS OF A U.S. STOCKHOLDER'S BASIS IN THE U.S. STOCKHOLDER'S SHARES WILL BE TREATED AS GAIN FROM THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S SHARES (SEE “TAXATION OF TAXABLE U.S. STOCKHOLDERS - DISPOSITION OF STOCK OF THE COMPANY” BELOW). CAPITAL GAINS DIVIDENDSDISTRIBUTIONS TO U.S. STOCKHOLDERS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CAPITAL GAIN DIVIDENDS WILL BE TAXED AS LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS (TO THE EXTENT THEY DO NOT EXCEED THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL NET CAPITAL GAIN FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR), WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PERIOD FOR WHICH A U.S. STOCKHOLDER HELD THE COMPANY'S SHARES. HOWEVER, A CORPORATE U.S. STOCKHOLDER, MAY BE REQUIRED TO TREAT A PORTION OF SOME CAPITAL GAIN DIVIDENDS AS ORDINARY INCOME.IF THE COMPANY ELECTS TO RETAIN AND PAY INCOME TAX ON ANY NET LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAIN, EACH OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. STOCKHOLDERS WOULD INCLUDE IN INCOME, AS LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAIN, ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THIS NET LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAIN. EACH OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. STOCKHOLDERS WOULD ALSO RECEIVE A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE TAX PAID BY THE COMPANY ON SUCH RETAINED CAPITAL GAINS AND WOULD HAVE AN INCREASE IN THE BASIS OF ITS SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ITS INCLUDABLE CAPITAL GAINS LESS ITS SHARE OF THE TAX DEEMED PAID.DISPOSITION OF STOCK OF THE COMPANYUPON ANY TAXABLE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF ANY SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK, A U.S. STOCKHOLDER WILL GENERALLY RECOGNIZE CAPITAL GAIN OR LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE AND THE U.S. STOCKHOLDER'S ADJUSTED TAX BASIS IN THESE SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK. THIS GAIN WILL BE CAPITAL GAIN IF THE U.S. STOCKHOLDER HELD THESE SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK AS A CAPITAL ASSET.3.8% TAX ON NET INVESTMENT INCOMEUNDER RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION, COMMENCING WITH TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2012, CERTAIN U.S. STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK WHO ARE INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES OR TRUSTS AND WHOSE INCOME EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLDS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY A 3.8% TAX ON CERTAIN “NET INVESTMENT INCOME,” INCLUDING DIVIDENDS ON THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AND CAPITAL GAINS FROM THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK.TAXATION OF TAX-EXEMPT STOCKHOLDERSTAX-EXEMPT ENTITIES ARE GENERALLY EXEMPT FROM FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION.  HOWEVER, THEY ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION ON THEIR UNRELATED BUSINESS TAXABLE INCOME (“UBTI”).  DISTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY TO A U.S. STOCKHOLDER THAT IS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY (SUCH AS AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (“IRA”) OR A 401(K) PLAN) GENERALLY SHOULD NOT CONSTITUTE UBTI, UNLESS SUCH TAX-EXEMPT U.S. STOCKHOLDER HAS FINANCED THE ACQUISITION OF ITS SHARES WITH “ACQUISITION INDEBTEDNESS” WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE CODE, OR THE SHARES ARE OTHERWISE USED IN AN UNRELATED TRADE OR BUSINESS CONDUCTED BY SUCH U.S. STOCKHOLDER.HOWEVER, FOR TAX-EXEMPT STOCKHOLDERS THAT ARE SOCIAL CLUBS, VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ASSOCIATIONS, SUPPLEMENTAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT TRUSTS AND QUALIFIED GROUP LEGAL SERVICES PLANS EXEMPT FROM FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION UNDER SECTIONS 501(C)(7), (C)(9), (C)(17) AND (C)(20) OF THE CODE, RESPECTIVELY, INCOME FROM AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY WILL CONSTITUTE UBTI UNLESS THE ORGANIZATION PROPERLY SETS ASIDE OR RESERVES SUCH AMOUNTS FOR PURPOSES SPECIFIED IN THE CODE.  SUCH TAX-EXEMPT STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THESE “SET ASIDE” AND RESERVE REQUIREMENTS.SPECIAL RULES APPLY TO CERTAIN TAX-EXEMPT PENSION FUNDS (INCLUDING 401(K) PLANS BUT EXCLUDING IRAS OR GOVERNMENT PENSION PLANS) THAT OWN MORE THAN 10% (MEASURED BY VALUE) OF A “PENSION-HELD REIT.” SUCH A PENSION FUND MAY BE REQUIRED TO TREAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF ALL DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM THE REIT DURING THE YEAR AS UBTI. THE PERCENTAGE IS EQUAL TO THE RATIO OF THE REIT'S GROSS INCOME (LESS DIRECT EXPENSES RELATED THERETO) DERIVED FROM THE CONDUCT OF UNRELATED TRADES OR BUSINESSES DETERMINED AS IF THE REIT WERE A TAX-EXEMPT PENSION FUND (INCLUDING INCOME FROM ACTIVITIES FINANCED WITH “ACQUISITION INDEBTEDNESS”), TO THE REIT'S GROSS INCOME (LESS DIRECT EXPENSES RELATED THERETO) FROM ALL SOURCES. THE SPECIAL RULES WILL NOT REQUIRE A PENSION FUND TO RECHARACTERIZE A PORTION OF ITS DIVIDENDS AS UBTI UNLESS THE PERCENTAGE COMPUTED IS AT LEAST 5%.A REIT WILL BE TREATED AS A “PENSION-HELD REIT” IF THE REIT IS PREDOMINANTLY HELD BY TAX-EXEMPT PENSION FUNDS AND IF THE REIT WOULD OTHERWISE FAIL TO SATISFY THE FIVE OR FEWER TEST DISCUSSED ABOVE. A REIT IS PREDOMINANTLY HELD BY TAX-EXEMPT PENSION FUNDS IF AT LEAST ONE TAX-EXEMPT PENSION FUND HOLDS MORE THAN 25% (MEASURED BY VALUE) OF THE REIT'S STOCK OR BENEFICIAL INTERESTS, OR IF ONE OR MORE TAX-EXEMPT PENSION FUNDS (EACH OF WHICH OWNS MORE THAN 10% (MEASURED BY VALUE) OF THE REIT'S STOCK OR BENEFICIAL INTERESTS) OWN IN THE AGGREGATE MORE THAN 50% (MEASURED BY VALUE) OF THE REIT'S STOCK OR BENEFICIAL INTERESTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL NOT BE TREATED AS A PENSION-HELD REIT. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE SHARES OF THE COMPANY WILL BE PUBLICLY TRADED, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT OR WILL NOT BECOME A PENSION-HELD REIT.TAXATION OF NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERSTHE RULES GOVERNING U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION OF  NON-RESIDENT ALIEN INDIVIDUALS, FOREIGN CORPORATIONS, FOREIGN PARTNERSHIPS AND FOREIGN TRUSTS AND ESTATES (“NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERS”) ARE COMPLEX, AND THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF SUCH RULES. NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL INCOME TAX LAWS ON AN INVESTMENT IN STOCK OF THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.DISTRIBUTIONS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO GAIN FROM THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF A “UNITED STATES REAL PROPERTY INTEREST”DISTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY TO NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERS THAT ARE NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO GAIN FROM THE SALE OR EXCHANGE BY THE COMPANY OF UNITED STATES REAL PROPERTY INTERESTS (“USRPI”) AND THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED BY THE COMPANY AS CAPITAL GAIN DIVIDENDS WILL BE TREATED AS ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS TO NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERS TO THE EXTENT MADE OUT OF CURRENT OR ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS OF THE COMPANY. GENERALLY, SUCH ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. WITHHOLDING TAX AT THE RATE OF 30% ON THE GROSS AMOUNT OF THE DIVIDEND PAID UNLESS REDUCED OR ELIMINATED BY AN APPLICABLE U.S. INCOME TAX TREATY. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO WITHHOLD U.S. INCOME TAX AT THE RATE OF 30% ON THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ANY SUCH DIVIDENDS PAID TO A NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER UNLESS A LOWER TREATY RATE APPLIES AND THE NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER HAS FILED AN IRS FORM W-8BEN WITH THE COMPANY, CERTIFYING THE NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER'S ENTITLEMENT TO TREATY BENEFITS.DISTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY TO NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERS IN EXCESS OF ITS CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS TO A NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER WHO HOLDS 5% OR LESS OF THE STOCK OF THE COMPANY (AFTER APPLICATION OF CERTAIN OWNERSHIP RULES) WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME OR WITHHOLDING TAX. IF IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME A DISTRIBUTION IS MADE WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISTRIBUTION WILL BE IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS, THE DISTRIBUTION WILL BE SUBJECT TO WITHHOLDING AT THE RATE APPLICABLE TO A DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION. HOWEVER, THE NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER MAY SEEK A REFUND FROM THE IRS OF ANY AMOUNT WITHHELD IF IT IS SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED THAT SUCH DISTRIBUTION WAS, IN FACT, IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY'S THEN CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS BY FILING A U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.        DISTRIBUTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GAIN FROM THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF A “UNITED STATES REAL PROPERTY INTEREST”SO LONG AS THE COMPANY'S STOCK CONTINUES TO BE REGULARLY TRADED ON AN ESTABLISHED SECURITIES MARKET, SUCH AS THE NYSE, LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, DISTRIBUTIONS TO A NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER HOLDING 5% OR LESS AT ALL TIMES DURING THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING ON THE DATE OF THE DISTRIBUTION WILL NOT BE TREATED AS ATTRIBUTABLE TO  GAIN FROM THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF A USRPI.  SEE, ""TAXATION OF NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERS - DISTRIBUTIONS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO GAIN FROM THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF A 'UNITED STATES REAL PROPERTY INTEREST'"" ABOVE. DISTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY TO NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO GAIN FROM THE SALE OR EXCHANGE BY THE COMPANY OF ANY USRPI WILL BE TAXED TO A NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER UNDER THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN REAL PROPERTY TAX ACT OF 1980 (“FIRPTA”) PROVISIONS.  UNDER FIRPTA, SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS ARE TAXED TO A NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER AS IF THE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE GAINS “EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED” WITH A U.S. TRADE OR BUSINESS. ACCORDINGLY, A NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER WILL BE TAXED AT THE NORMAL CAPITAL GAIN RATES APPLICABLE TO A U.S. STOCKHOLDER (SUBJECT TO ANY APPLICABLE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND A SPECIAL ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX IN THE CASE OF NON-RESIDENT ALIEN INDIVIDUALS). DISTRIBUTIONS SUBJECT TO FIRPTA ALSO MAY BE SUBJECT TO A 30% BRANCH PROFITS TAX WHEN MADE TO A CORPORATE NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER THAT IS NOT ENTITLED TO A TREATY EXEMPTION. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO WITHHOLD 35% OF ANY DISTRIBUTION THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GAIN FROM THE SALE OR EXCHANGE BY THE COMPANY OF ANY USRPI, WHETHER OR NOT DESIGNATED BY THE COMPANY AS A CAPITAL GAINS DIVIDEND.  SUCH AMOUNT IS CREDITABLE AGAINST THE NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER'S FIRPTA TAX LIABILITY.  SALE OR DISPOSITION OF STOCK OF THE COMPANYGENERALLY, GAIN RECOGNIZED BY A NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER UPON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF STOCK OF THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO U.S. TAXATION UNLESS SUCH STOCK CONSTITUTES A USRPI WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FIRPTA. THE STOCK OF THE COMPANY WILL NOT CONSTITUTE A USRPI SO LONG AS THE COMPANY IS A “DOMESTICALLY CONTROLLED REIT.”  A “DOMESTICALLY CONTROLLED REIT” IS A REIT IN WHICH AT ALL TIMES DURING A SPECIFIED TESTING PERIOD LESS THAN 50% IN VALUE OF ITS STOCK OR BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ARE HELD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL BE A “DOMESTICALLY CONTROLLED REIT,” AND THEREFORE THAT THE SALE OF STOCK OF THE COMPANY WILL GENERALLY NOT BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION UNDER FIRPTA.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE STOCK OF THE COMPANY IS PUBLICLY TRADED, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY IS OR WILL CONTINUE TO BE A “DOMESTICALLY CONTROLLED REIT.”IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A “DOMESTICALLY CONTROLLED REIT,” GAIN ARISING FROM THE SALE OR EXCHANGE BY A NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER OF STOCK OF THE COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES TAXATION UNDER FIRPTA AS A SALE OF A USRPI UNLESS (I) THE STOCK OF THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY TRADED ON AN ESTABLISHED SECURITIES MARKET, SUCH AS THE NYSE, LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND (II) THE SELLING NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER'S INTEREST (AFTER APPLICATION OF CERTAIN CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP RULES) IN THE COMPANY IS 5% OR LESS AT ALL TIMES DURING THE FIVE YEARS PRECEDING THE SALE OR EXCHANGE. IF GAIN ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF THE STOCK OF THE COMPANY WERE SUBJECT TO TAXATION UNDER FIRPTA, THE NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER WOULD BE SUBJECT TO REGULAR U.S. INCOME TAX WITH RESPECT TO SUCH GAIN IN THE SAME MANNER AS A U.S. STOCKHOLDER (SUBJECT TO ANY APPLICABLE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX, A SPECIAL ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX IN THE CASE OF NONRESIDENT ALIEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE POSSIBLE APPLICATION OF THE 30% BRANCH PROFITS TAX IN THE CASE OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS), AND THE PURCHASER OF THE STOCK OF THE COMPANY (INCLUDING THE COMPANY) WOULD BE REQUIRED TO WITHHOLD AND REMIT TO THE IRS 10% OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. ADDITIONALLY, IN SUCH CASE, DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE STOCK OF THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT THEY REPRESENT A RETURN OF CAPITAL OR CAPITAL GAIN FROM THE SALE OF THE STOCK OF THE COMPANY, RATHER THAN DIVIDENDS, WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A 10% WITHHOLDING TAX.CAPITAL GAINS NOT SUBJECT TO FIRPTA WILL NONETHELESS BE TAXABLE IN THE UNITED STATES TO A NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER IN TWO CASES:•IF THE NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER'S INVESTMENT IN THE STOCK OF THE COMPANY IS EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED WITH A U.S. TRADE OR BUSINESS CONDUCTED BY SUCH NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER, THE NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME TREATMENT AS A U.S. STOCKHOLDER WITH RESPECT TO SUCH GAIN; OR•IF THE NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDER IS A NONRESIDENT ALIEN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS PRESENT IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 183 DAYS OR MORE DURING THE TAXABLE YEAR AND HAS A “TAX HOME” IN THE UNITED STATES, THE NONRESIDENT ALIEN INDIVIDUAL WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME TREATMENT AS A U.S. STOCKHOLDER WITH RESPECT TO SUCH GAIN.        3.8% TAX ON NET INVESTMENT INCOMENON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERS WHO ARE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE 3.8% TAX ON NET INVESTMENT INCOME, WHICH IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO U.S. INDIVIDUALS, TRUSTS AND ESTATES.

AT A MEETING HELD ON MARCH 18, 2013, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE COMMITTEE) OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES (THE BOARD) OF LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST (THE COMPANY) APPROVED THE LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST 2013 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2013 PLAN), WITH THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. THE 2013 PLAN IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR IN DESIGN TO THE LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST 2012 THROUGH 2008 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS, IN THAT IT PROVIDES FOR AN ANNUAL AGGREGATE AWARD (EACH, AN AWARD) COMPOSED OF (I) A GRANT OF PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THE TOTAL TARGETED EXPECTED VALUE OF THE AWARD), AND (II) A GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS (APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE TOTAL TARGETED EXPECTED VALUE OF THE AWARD).  WHEN THE COMPANYS COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST, $0.001 PAR VALUE (THE COMMON SHARES), ARE ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO THE AWARDS THEY UNDERLIE, THEY WILL BE ISSUED UNDER THE COMPANYS AMENDED AND RESTATED SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN (THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN), AND SHALL GENERALLY BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THAT PLAN.
 
THE 2013 PLAN IS DESCRIBED BELOW IN MORE DETAIL.
 
2013 PLAN
 
AWARDS UNDER THE 2013 PLAN WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING GENERAL FEATURES:
 
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. A RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT (RSU) UNDER THE 2013 PLAN CONSISTS OF A LEGALLY-BINDING PROMISE TO PAY THE EXECUTIVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE COMMON SHARES AT THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD (AS DEFINED BELOW), TO THE EXTENT CERTAIN ANNUAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE MET OR EXCEEDED.
 
THE RSUS SHALL BE ELIGIBLE TO BE EARNED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD (THE AWARD PERIOD), AND SHALL BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO (I) A PORTION EARNED RATABLY OVER THE AWARD PERIOD ON A YEAR-BY-YEAR BASIS (EACH YEAR CONSTITUTING A RELATED PERFORMANCE PERIOD), USING A SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASURE (THE FIRST PORTION), AND (II) A PORTION EARNED OVER THE FULL AWARD PERIOD, USING ANOTHER SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASURE (THE SECOND PORTION). NEITHER PORTION, HOWEVER, WOULD BE PAYABLE UNTIL THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR AWARD PERIOD. ANY DIVIDENDS THAT ACCUMULATE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD WILL BE PAID IF AND WHEN THE RELATED RSUS ARE REDEEMED AND PAID.
 
UNDER THE 2013 PLAN, THE COMMITTEE HAS THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE A WIDE VARIETY OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES ON WHICH TO BASE EACH PARTICULAR YEARS GRANT OF RSUS, AND WILL ACT EACH YEAR TO DESIGNATE THE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THAT YEAR. FOR THE AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE 2013 PLAN, AS DISCUSSED MORE SPECIFICALLY BELOW, THESE TWO MEASURES ARE BASED, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AS ADJUSTED IF APPROPRIATE) (THE FFO PORTION) FOR THE FIRST PORTION OF THE AWARD, AND ITS TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (THE TSR PORTION) AS COMPARED TO A RELEVANT PEER GROUP FOR THE SECOND PORTION OF THE AWARD. THE COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED A PERFORMANCE METRICS SCHEDULE FOR THE AWARDS TO BE GRANTED UNDER THE 2013 PLAN,
 
1





 
LISTING THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH THE ACTUAL FFO PORTION AND TSR PORTION WILL ACCRUE, IN RELATION TO THE SPECIFIED TARGET LEVELS. THESE LEVELS PROVIDE FOR SPECIFIED AWARDS UPON ATTAINMENT OF STIPULATED PERCENTAGES OF THE TARGET LEVEL (AND INCLUDE A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES PAYABLE OF 200% (272% FOR OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER) OF BOTH THE FIRST PORTION AND THE SECOND PORTION), WITH THE COMMITTEE RETAINING DISCRETION TO REDUCE THE AWARD FROM THE PRESCRIBED LEVEL AS IT DEEMS FIT.
 
THE RSUS THAT COMPRISE THE FIRST PORTION WILL BE SPLIT INTO THREE EQUAL PIECES, CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE RELEVANT AWARD PERIOD. DEPENDING ON HOW EACH YEARS PERFORMANCE COMPARES TO TARGET PERFORMANCE FOR THAT YEAR USING AN ANNUALLY-DETERMINED PERFORMANCE SCHEDULE, A PORTION OF THE RELATED RSUS WILL BE DEEMED EARNED FOR THAT YEAR, AND WILL BE PAYABLE TO THE PARTICIPANT IN COMMON SHARES (UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN) AT THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD. THE RSUS THAT COMPRISE THE SECOND PORTION ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE EARNED ON THE BASIS OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN FOR THE RELEVANT AWARD PERIOD, USING A PERFORMANCE SCHEDULE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD. THE SECOND PORTION WILL BE DEEMED EARNED AND PAYABLE TO THE PARTICIPANT IN COMMON SHARES (UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN) AT THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD.
 
IF A RECIPIENT OF AN AWARD QUITS OR IS DISCHARGED FOR CAUSE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD, ALL RSUS WILL BE FORFEITED, EVEN IF THEY HAVE (IN THE CASE OF THE FIRST PORTION THAT ACCRUES ON A YEAR-BY-YEAR BASIS) ALREADY BEEN EARNED. IF THE RECIPIENT OF AN AWARD IS, INSTEAD, TERMINATED WITHOUT CAUSE, OR TERMINATES BY REASON OF DEATH, DISABILITY OR RETIREMENT (AS DEFINED IN THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN) PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD, THE TREATMENT OF THE RSUS SHALL BE AS SET FORTH IN THE GRANT DOCUMENTS. THE 2013 PLAN ALSO INCLUDES SEVERAL COMMON CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUBJECT TO THE COMMITTEES DISCRETION, THAT WOULD TRIGGER FORFEITURE OF AN AWARD.
 
OPTIONS.  STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE 2013 PLAN WILL BE VESTED (AND THUS EXERCISABLE) SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF TIME AND CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT, WITH NO REGARD TO ANY PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AT A RATE OF 20% OF THE TOTAL OPTION COMPONENT AT THE END OF THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF GRANT, 30% ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY, AND THE REMAINDER ON THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY. IN ADDITION, THEY WILL BECOME IMMEDIATELY VESTED AND EXERCISABLE IN FULL IF THE OPTIONEE CEASES TO BE EMPLOYED BY, OR PROVIDE SERVICES TO, THE TRUST BY REASON OF DEATH OR DISABILITY OR, SUBJECT TO A SLIDING SCALE, RETIREMENT.  THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE, GENERALLY, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT CURRENTLY GOVERN OPTIONS GRANTED TO NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS PART OF THE COMPANYS LTI PROGRAM, AND THUS DO NOT REPRESENT A CHANGE IN THAT COMPONENT OF THE LTI PROGRAM.
 
ON MARCH 18, 2013, THE COMMITTEE MADE AWARDS UNDER THE 2013 PLAN, SUCH AWARDS TO BE GRANTED AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MARCH 18, 2013.  THE AWARDS CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING:

ON MAY 13, 2013, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. (THE COMPANY) ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS COMMENCING AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING OF 6,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  THE OFFERING PRICE AND OTHER TERMS ARE TO BE DETERMINED BY NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE UNDERWRITERS.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO GRANT THE UNDERWRITERS A THIRTY-DAY OPTION TO PURCHASE UP TO 900,000 ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.
 
THE COMPANY HEREBY UPDATES ITS GUIDANCE AS OF MAY 13, 2013, FOR FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO) PER SHARE (DILUTED) AND EARNINGS PER SHARE (DILUTED) FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013, BASED ON THE EXPECTED TERMS OF THE OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK AND OTHER FACTORS.  CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS GUIDANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013, ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING:
 
·                  PUBLIC OFFERING OF 6,000,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK PLUS 900,000 ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO AN OPTION GRANTED TO THE UNDERWRITERS.
 
·                  THE COMPANY HAS RE-EVALUATED ITS PREVIOUS DECISION TO EXECUTE A PARTIAL SALE OF ITS INTEREST IN THE 75/125 BINNEY STREET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AND NOW PLANS TO RETAIN 100% OWNERSHIP OF THE PROJECT.  THIS REASSESSMENT WILL ALLOW THE COMPANY TO FULLY CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL UPSIDE FROM THIS PROJECT AND WILL INCREASE ITS PLANNED INVESTMENT IN THE PROJECT BY A RANGE OF $60 MILLION TO $70 MILLION.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS PROJECTED CONSTRUCTION SPENDING IN 2013 RELATED TO THE 75/125 BINNEY STREET PROJECT WILL INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $47 MILLION.
 
·                  ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL INCOME PRODUCING PROPERTIES IN A RANGE FROM $200 MILLION TO $300 MILLION.
 
·                  THE COMPANYS GUIDANCE ASSUMES THE POTENTIAL ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES PAYABLE EARLIER IN 2013 THAN PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED.  THE COMPANYS PRIOR GUIDANCE ASSUMED THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES PAYABLE LATER IN 2013.
 
·                  THE COMPANY EXPECTS CAPITALIZED INTEREST TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION COMPARED TO ITS PREVIOUS GUIDANCE PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANYS PROJECTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE USED FOR CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST FOR 2013 RELATED TO AN UPDATE TO THE COMPANYS PROJECTED TIMING OF THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES PAYABLE FROM LATER IN 2013 TO EARLIER IN 2013.  ADDITIONALLY, CAPITALIZED INTEREST IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE DUE TO ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE COMPANYS DECISION TO RETAIN 100% OWNERSHIP OF ITS 75/125 BINNEY STREET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.  THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CAPITALIZED INTEREST FOR 2013 RELATED TO PROJECTS INCLUDED IN CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS OTHER THAN THE 75/125 BINNEY STREET PROJECT.  THE EARLIER PROJECTED ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES PAYABLE, COUPLED WITH THE INITIAL USE OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OFFERING, IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE COMPANYS UNSECURED SENIOR LINE OF CREDIT.  THE REDUCTION IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANYS UNSECURED SENIOR LINE OF CREDIT IN 2013 WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANYS WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE USED IN THE CALCULATION OF CAPITALIZED INTEREST.  IN AGGREGATE, THE COMPANYS WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE USED IN THE CALCULATION OF CAPITALIZED INTEREST FOR 2013 IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY 0.15% TO 0.20% FOR 2013, COMPARED TO THE COMPANYS PREVIOUS GUIDANCE.
 
·                  THE COMPANY EXPECTS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, TO DECLINE BY APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION COMPARED TO ITS PREVIOUS GUIDANCE PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PROJECTED NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AS A RESULT OF THE OFFERING, IN COMPARISON TO THE COMPANYS PRIOR ASSUMPTION OF $125 MILLION TO $175 MILLION IN NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL INTEREST COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPDATED TIMING OF THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES PAYABLE AND AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT AND CONSTRUCTION FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 75/125 BINNEY STREET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.
 
·                  THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE VELOCITY OF LEASING ACTIVITY TO ACCELERATE AND AN OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN OCCUPANCY BY THE END OF 2013, COMPARED TO ITS PREVIOUS GUIDANCE.

(1)         THE DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ON A PER SHARE BASIS IN THE COMPANYS CURRENT GUIDANCE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE PROJECTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS, THE COMPANYS UNHEDGED VARIABLE RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEBT MAY RANGE UP TO 30%.  THE COMPANYS STRATEGY IS TO HAVE UNHEDGED VARIABLE RATE DEBT AVAILABLE FOR REPAYMENT AS IT ISSUES UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES PAYABLE, EXTENDS ITS MATURITY PROFILE, TRANSITIONS VARIABLE RATE DEBT TO FIXED RATE DEBT, AND ENHANCES ITS LONG-TERM CAPITAL STRUCTURE.  THE COMPANYS UNHEDGED VARIABLE RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEBT IS TARGETED TO DECREASE TO LESS THAN 18% BY DECEMBER 31, 2013.

(2)          SEE THE TABLE OF 2013 NON-INCOME-PRODUCING ASSET SALES ON THE NEXT PAGE.  THE COMPANY HAS RE-EVALUATED ITS PREVIOUS DECISION TO EXECUTE A PARTIAL SALE OF ITS INTEREST IN THE 75/125 BINNEY STREET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AND NOW PLANS TO RETAIN 100% OWNERSHIP OF THE PROJECT.  THIS REASSESSMENT WILL INCREASE ITS PLANNED INVESTMENT IN THE PROJECT BY A RANGE OF $60 MILLION TO $70 MILLION.
(3)          SEE FOOTNOTE 2 ABOVE.  AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS PLAN TO RETAIN 100% OF THIS PROJECT, THE COMPANYS SECURED CONSTRUCTION LOAN BORROWINGS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION AND WILL BE INCLUDED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE COMPANYS PRIOR GUIDANCE ASSUMED THIS LOAN WAS CLASSIFIED AT THE UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE LEVEL.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO OBTAIN A SECURED CONSTRUCTION LOAN TO FUND 60% TO 70% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COSTS FOR THIS PROJECT.
(4)          THE COMPANYS GUIDANCE RANGE INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF 6 MILLION TO 6.9 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK.  THE FINAL NET PROCEEDS WILL BE DETERMINED BASED UPON THE FINAL TERMS OF THE COMMON STOCK OFFERING AND THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL SHARES SOLD PURSUANT TO THE UNDERWRITERS THIRTY-DAY OPTION TO PURCHASE UP TO 900,000 ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.
(5)          SEE FOOTNOTE 2 ABOVE.  AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS PLAN TO HOLD 100% OF THE 75/125 BINNEY STREET PROJECT, THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE PROJECTED CONSTRUCTION SPENDING FOR 2013 INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $47 MILLION OVER ITS PRIOR GUIDANCE.  THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COST AT COMPLETION FOR 75/125 BINNEY STREET HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE AS OF MARCH 31, 2013.
(6)          THE COMPANYS PRIOR GUIDANCE ASSUMED NO PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS, BUT THE COMPANY CONTINUOUSLY AND INTENSIVELY REVIEWS A PIPELINE OF OPPORTUNISTIC PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS IN THE COMPANYS KEY CORE CLUSTER MARKETS THAT THE COMPANY WOULD EXPECT TO FUND ON A LEVERAGE-NEUTRAL BASIS.  THE COMPANYS CURRENT GUIDANCE ASSUMES $200 MILLION TO $300 MILLION OF NEAR-TERM ACQUISITIONS OF INCOME PRODUCING PROPERTIES IN THE COMPANYS KEY CORE CLUSTER MARKETS.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, AS ADJUSTED
 
GAAP BASIS ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS UTILIZES HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND ASSUMES THAT REAL ESTATE VALUES DIMINISH OVER TIME.  IN AN EFFORT TO OVERCOME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REAL ESTATE VALUES AND HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (NAREIT) ESTABLISHED THE MEASUREMENT TOOL OF FFO.  SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION, FFO HAS BECOME A WIDELY USED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AMONG EQUITY REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITS).  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO IS HELPFUL TO INVESTORS AS AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF AN EQUITY REIT.  MOREOVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO, AS ADJUSTED, IS ALSO HELPFUL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS INVESTORS TO COMPARE THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF OTHER REAL ESTATE COMPANIES BETWEEN PERIODS, AND ON A CONSISTENT BASIS, WITHOUT HAVING TO ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENCES CAUSED BY INVESTMENT AND DISPOSITION DECISIONS, FINANCING DECISIONS, TERMS OF SECURITIES, CAPITAL STRUCTURES, AND CAPITAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS.  THE COMPANY COMPUTES FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF NAREIT IN ITS APRIL 2002 WHITE PAPER AND RELATED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (NAREIT WHITE PAPER).  THE NAREIT WHITE PAPER DEFINES FFO AS NET INCOME (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP), EXCLUDING GAINS (LOSSES) FROM SALES OF DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE AND LAND PARCELS AND IMPAIRMENTS OF DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE (EXCLUDING LAND PARCELS), PLUS REAL ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES.  IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE RELATE TO DECREASES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF REAL ESTATE DUE TO CHANGES IN GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND DO NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPERTIES DURING THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD.  IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE REPRESENT THE NON-CASH WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS WHEN FAIR VALUE OVER THE RECOVERABILITY PERIOD IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE.  THE COMPANY COMPUTES FFO, AS ADJUSTED, AS FFO CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NAREIT WHITE PAPER, PLUS LOSSES ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, PREFERRED STOCK REDEMPTION CHARGES, AND IMPAIRMENTS OF LAND PARCELS, LESS REALIZED GAIN ON EQUITY INVESTMENT PRIMARILY RELATED TO ONE NON-TENANT LIFE SCIENCE ENTITY, AND THE AMOUNT OF SUCH ITEMS THAT IS ALLOCABLE TO THE COMPANYS UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  THE COMPANYS CALCULATIONS OF BOTH FFO AND FFO, AS ADJUSTED, MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE METHODOLOGIES UTILIZED BY OTHER EQUITY REITS FOR SIMILAR PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS, AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER EQUITY REITS.  NEITHER FFO NOR FFO, AS ADJUSTED, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME (DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP) AS AN INDICATION OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, OR TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES (DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP) AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY, NOR ARE THEY INDICATIVE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR THE COMPANYS CASH NEEDS, INCLUDING FUNDS AVAILABLE TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS.

HEREIN AS THE UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT) WITH BARCLAYS CAPITAL INC., MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED, J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SEVERAL UNDERWRITERS
NAMED THEREIN, IN CONNECTION WITH THE PUBLIC OFFERING BY THE COMPANY OF UP TO 6,325,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.01, INCLUDING 825,000 SHARES WHICH MAY BE PURCHASED AT THE OPTION OF THE UNDERWRITERS PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE
UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT. A COPY OF THE UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 1.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THE OPINION OF BALLARD SPAHR LLP WITH RESPECT TO THE VALIDITY OF THE SHARES IN THIS
OFFERING IS FILED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 5.1.  B. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. UNLESS OTHERWISE
EXPRESSLY STATED OR THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, WE, US AND OUR REFER COLLECTIVELY TO THE COMPANY, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND THE COMPANYS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. 
PENDING ACQUISITION. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE TWO FULLY-LEASED PROPERTIES AND AN ADJACENT LAND PARCEL THAT
WE MAY SEEK TO DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE IN SAN DIEGO FOR APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION. THE ACQUISITION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013. HOWEVER, THIS ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT TO CLOSING CONDITIONS AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES AND WE CANNOT
PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE CONSUMMATED AT THE PRICE, ON THE TERMS OR BY THE DATE CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATED, OR AT ALL.  IN ADDITION, AS
A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE PROPERTY ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE. AS A RESULT, WE TYPICALLY HAVE ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS (IN ADDITION TO THE PENDING ACQUISITION DISCUSSED ABOVE) UNDER
CONSIDERATION THAT ARE IN VARYING STAGES OF NEGOTIATION AND DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW, OR UNDER CONTRACT, AT ANY POINT IN TIME. HOWEVER, THOSE AGREEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CLOSING CONDITIONS AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL
ACQUIRE THE PROPERTIES SUBJECT TO THOSE AGREEMENTS. LIKEWISE, WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ENTER INTO ANY ADDITIONAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE PROPERTIES OR, IF WE DO, THAT THE ACQUISITIONS WILL CLOSE. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH
ACQUISITIONS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPLETE AN ACQUISITION AFTER MAKING A NONREFUNDABLE DEPOSIT OR INCURRING ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS. IN ADDITION, ACQUISITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. FOR
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE RISK FACTORSRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONSWE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPLETE ACQUISITIONS AND SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE ACQUIRED PROPERTIES IN THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR
THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012.  LEASING ACTIVITY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, WE HAD ENTERED INTO NON-BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT FOR LEASES
TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 400,000 RENTABLE SQUARE FEET IN OUR OFFICE PROPERTIES. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THESE LETTERS OF INTENT WILL RESULT IN LEASES, OR WHEN THE SPACE AVAILABLE FOR RENT MAY ULTIMATELY BE LEASED. 
CAPITAL RECYCLING. AS PART OF OUR CURRENT AND ONGOING STRATEGY, WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF
PROPERTIES AND UNDEVELOPED LAND IN OUR PORTFOLIO WITH THE INTENT OF RECYCLING THE PROCEEDS GENERATED FROM THE DISPOSITION OF NON-STRATEGIC PROPERTIES INTO CAPITAL TO FUND NEW OPERATING AND DEVELOPMENT ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT
EXPENDITURES, TO REPAY LONG-TERM DEBT AND FOR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL RECYCLING STRATEGY, WE INTEND, WHEN PRACTICAL, TO STRUCTURE THOSE DISPOSITIONS AS LIKE-KIND EXCHANGES PURSUANT TO SECTION 1031 OF THE INTERNAL
REVENUE CODE OF 1986 (SECTION 1031 EXCHANGES) TO DEFER SOME OR ALL OF THE TAXABLE GAINS, IF ANY, ON THE SALES FOR FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX PURPOSES. 
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS STRATEGY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE COULD DISPOSE OF APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION TO $400 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL OPERATING PROPERTIES AND/OR
UNDEVELOPED LAND DURING THE NEXT 18 MONTHS. THE TIMING OF ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE DISPOSITION TRANSACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO OUR CAPITAL NEEDS, DEMAND FOR OUR PROPERTIES AND OUR ABILITY TO
DEFER SOME OR ALL OF THE TAXABLE GAINS, IF ANY, ON THE SALES. SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF VARIOUS CRITERIA, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE ASSET FOR IMMEDIATE SALE, THE EXISTENCE OF AN ACTIVE PROGRAM TO LOCATE A BUYER, AND
THE PROBABLE SALE OR TRANSFER OF THE ASSET WITHIN ONE YEAR, ANY OPERATING PROPERTY AND/OR UNDEVELOPED LAND WE ARE SEEKING TO DISPOSE OF MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL DISPOSE
OF ANY ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES, OR THAT FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND/OR DISPOSITIONS, IF ANY, WILL QUALIFY AS SECTION 1031 EXCHANGES.

ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2013, SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST, OR WE OR US, AMENDED THE AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OR THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND A SYNDICATE OF OTHER LENDERS.  AS OF THE DATE OF THE AMENDMENT, WE HAD $125.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT.
 
AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT, THE STATED MATURITY DATE OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WAS EXTENDED FROM JUNE 24, 2015 TO JANUARY 15, 2018.  SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT OF AN EXTENSION FEE AND MEETING CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS, WE ALSO HAVE AN OPTION TO FURTHER EXTEND THE STATED MATURITY DATE BY AN ADDITIONAL ONE YEAR.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT WE CAN BORROW, REPAY AND REBORROW FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT UNTIL MATURITY, AND NO PRINCIPAL REPAYMENT IS DUE UNTIL MATURITY.  THE $750.0 MILLION AMOUNT OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY REMAINED UNCHANGED BY THE AMENDMENT. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT CONTINUES TO INCLUDE A FEATURE UNDER WHICH MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITY MAY BE INCREASED TO UP TO $1.5 BILLION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT, THE INTEREST RATE PAID ON BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT WAS REDUCED FROM LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM OF 160 BASIS POINTS TO LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM OF 130 BASIS POINTS, AND THE FACILITY FEE WAS REDUCED FROM 35 BASIS POINTS TO 30 BASIS POINTS PER ANNUM ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LENDING COMMITMENTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT.  BOTH THE INTEREST RATE PREMIUM AND THE FACILITY FEE ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT RATINGS.  THE AMENDMENT ALSO REVISED THE DEFINITION OF LIBOR TO REFERENCE THE REUTERS SCREEN LIBOR01 PAGE.
 
OUR BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT CONTINUE TO BE UNSECURED.  PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AMENDMENT, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAD GUARANTEED OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT.  AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT, ALL THOSE SUBSIDIARIES WERE RELEASED FROM THEIR GUARANTEES, AND THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, A SUBSIDIARY IS REQUIRED TO GUARANTY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT ONLY IF THAT SUBSIDIARY HAS SEPARATELY INCURRED DEBT (OTHER THAN NONRECOURSE DEBT), WITHIN THE MEANING SPECIFIED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, OR PROVIDED A GUARANTEE OF DEBT INCURRED BY US OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES.
 
THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS WHICH RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO INCUR DEBTS, INCLUDING DEBTS SECURED BY MORTGAGES ON OUR PROPERTIES IN EXCESS OF CALCULATED AMOUNTS, REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM NET WORTH, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL RATIOS, AND PROVIDES FOR ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS DUE THEREUNDER UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND CONTINUATION OF CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF US AND THE TERMINATION OF OUR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT OR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH REIT MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH LLC IF NOT APPROVED BY OUR LENDERS AS PROVIDED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  THE AMENDMENT (I) MODIFIED OUR COVENANT NOT TO AMEND, MODIFY OR DEFAULT IN PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS TO ALIGN WITH THE APPLICABLE PREEXISTING STANDARDS APPLYING TO OUR OTHER MATERIAL CONTRACTS, AND (II) REVISED THE DEFINITION OF CHANGE OF CONTROL TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE REFERENCED FROM 10% TO 25% OF OUR TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES.
 
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ON AUGUST 8, 2013, OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES APPROVED THE ISSUANCE OF A LETTER TO A LARGE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM THAT MANAGES MUTUAL FUNDS PERMITTING SUCH FIRM TO EXCEED CERTAIN OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST AND BYLAWS AND RIGHTS AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND EQUISERVE TRUST COMPANY, N.A., DATED AS OF MARCH 10, 2004, AS AMENDED.

TEXAS ACQUISITION  PURCHASE AGREEMENTS  COUSINS PROPERTIES INCORPORATED (THE COMPANY, WE, US OR OUR) ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE CONTRACT (THE GREENWAY PURCHASE AGREEMENT), DATED
AS OF JULY 19, 2013, WITH CRESCENT CROWN GREENWAY PLAZA SPV, LLC, CRESCENT CROWN SEVEN GREENWAY SPV, LLC, CRESCENT CROWN NINE GREENWAY SPV, LLC, AND CRESCENT CROWN EDLOE GARAGE SPV, LLC, AFFILIATES OF CRESCENT REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS, LLC
(SELLER), TO PURCHASE GREENWAY PLAZA, A 10-BUILDING, APPROXIMATELY 4.4 MILLION SQUARE FOOT OFFICE COMPLEX IN HOUSTON, TEXAS, FOR APPROXIMATELY $950 MILLION, BEFORE ADJUSTMENT FOR BROKERS FEES, TRANSFER TAXES, AND OTHER
CUSTOMARY CLOSING COSTS. ON THE SAME DATE, WE ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE CONTRACT (THE 777 MAIN PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND TOGETHER WITH THE GREENWAY PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS) WITH MS CRESCENT ONE SPV,
LLC, AN AFFILIATE OF SELLER, TO PURCHASE 777 MAIN STREET, AN APPROXIMATELY 980,000 SQUARE FOOT CLASS A OFFICE BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN FORT WORTH, TEXAS, FOR APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION, BEFORE ADJUSTMENT FOR BROKERS FEES, TRANSFER TAXES, AND
OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING COSTS. WE REFER TO THE ACQUISITION OF THESE PROPERTIES AS THE TEXAS ACQUISITION. THE GROSS AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IS APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION IN CASH. THE ASSETS WILL BE WHOLLY-OWNED
BY US AND REMAIN UNENCUMBERED OF DEBT AT CLOSING.  UPON THE SIGNING OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WE POSTED A $15 MILLION AGGREGATE EARNEST
MONEY DEPOSIT, WHICH WAS REFUNDABLE DURING THE DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD. DURING THE DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD, SELLER HAD THE OPTION TO TERMINATE THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS UPON THE PAYMENT OF $30 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. 
ON JULY 29, 2013, THE REMAINING DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WAS WAIVED. UPON THE TERMINATION OF THE DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD,
SELLERS OPTION TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENTS UPON THE PAYMENT OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES EXPIRED AND WE POSTED AN ADDITIONAL EARNEST MONEY DEPOSIT OF $15 MILLION FOR A TOTAL OF $30 MILLION IN EARNEST MONEY, WHICH IS NON-REFUNDABLE EXCEPT IN LIMITED
CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE EXPECTED CLOSING DATE FOR THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IS SEPTEMBER 9, 2013, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OR WAIVER OF
CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND PROVIDED THAT WE MAY ELECT FOR THE CLOSING TO OCCUR ON AN EARLIER DATE. 
THE AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, EACH OF THE GREENWAY
PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND THE 777 MAIN PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS CONTINGENT ON THE SUCCESSFUL CLOSING OF THE OTHER. IF WE ELECT NOT TO CLOSE ON THE TEXAS ACQUISITION WHEN OBLIGATED TO DO SO UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WE WILL FORFEIT OUR $30 MILLION
TOTAL EARNEST MONEY DEPOSIT.  THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IS NOT SUBJECT TO A FINANCING CONDITION. WE PLAN TO FUND THE CASH
PURCHASE PRICE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM AN EQUITY ISSUANCE, CASH ON HAND FROM THE DISPOSITION OF EXISTING OWNED PROPERTIES, NEW SECURED PROPERTY-LEVEL DEBT AND, ON AN INTERIM BASIS, FUNDS DRAWN UNDER A NEW $950 MILLION TERM LOAN
FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW.  COPIES OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBITS 2.1 AND 2.2, AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MATERIAL
TERMS OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN THIS ITEM 1.01 ARE QUALIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO SUCH EXHIBITS, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  TEXAS ACQUISITION  TERM LOAN  ON JULY 29, 2013, WE ENTERED INTO A LOAN AGREEMENT WITH
JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. (JPM) AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. WHICH WOULD PERMIT US TO DRAW UP TO $950 MILLION UNDER A NEW TERM LOAN FACILITY, WITH AN ACCORDION FEATURE PERMITTING US TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE BY UP TO $150 MILLION IF
WE REQUEST AND RECEIVE ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE INCREASE, FOR AN AGGREGATE AVAILABLE FACILITY AMOUNT UP TO $1.1 BILLION (THE TERM LOAN). THE TERM LOAN MATURES ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION, WITH
TWO ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OPTIONS (FOR THE FIRST ONE-YEAR EXTENSION ONLY UP TO $500 MILLION CAN BE EXTENDED AND FOR THE SECOND ONE-YEAR EXTENSION ONLY UP TO $375 MILLION CAN BE EXTENDED), THAT WE MAY EXERCISE UPON THE SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS
AND THE PAYMENT OF EXTENSION FEES. FUNDING OF THE TERM LOAN, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, WOULD BE PROVIDED IN A SINGLE DRAW-DOWN CONCURRENTLY WITH THE CLOSING OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION. THE COMMITMENTS AVAILABLE TO BE FUNDED UNDER THE TERM LOAN WILL
DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT NECESSARY TO FUND THE TEXAS ACQUISITION AFTER THE USE OF ALL OR A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF AN EQUITY ISSUANCE, THE ANTICIPATED PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND THE INCURRENCE OF NEW SECURED PROPERTY-LEVEL DEBT.

SIMILAR TO THOSE IN OUR EXISTING SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR OUR $350 MILLION SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT. THE SIMILAR FINANCIAL COVENANTS REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MAINTENANCE OF A MINIMUM
SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE AMOUNT OF (I) $473.6 MILLION PLUS (II) 70% OF THE NET CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM FUTURE EQUITY ISSUANCES, THE MAINTENANCE OF AN UNENCUMBERED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 2.00 TO 1.00, A FIXED CHARGE

GREENWAY PLAZA AND 777 MAIN STREET KEY TENANTS IDENTIFIED ABOVE REPRESENT 42% AND 35% OF RENTABLE SQUARE FEET, RESPECTIVELY. THE BREAKDOWN OF RENTABLE SQUARE FEET
REPRESENTED BY EACH TENANT IS AS FOLLOWS. FOR GREENWAY PLAZA  OCCIDENTAL, 725,282; INVESCO, 380,601; TRANSOCEAN, 333,734; EXXONMOBIL, 214,857; AND CPL RETAIL ENERGY, 173,760. FOR 777 MAIN STREET  FRAC TECH SERVICES, 98,374; JACOBS

(2)
WEIGHTED AVERAGE OCCUPANCY IS CALCULATED AS THE TOTAL OCCUPIED RENTABLE SQUARE FEET WITHIN ALL BUILDINGS WITHIN THE ASSET (DETERMINED ON THE LAST DAY OF EACH MONTH, AND
AVERAGED OVER CALENDAR YEAR 2012), DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL RENTABLE SQUARE FEET WITHIN ALL BUILDINGS WITHIN THE ASSET. 


(3)
REFLECTS STATED EXPIRATION DATES; DOES NOT REFLECT EARLY TERMINATION RIGHTS IN CERTAIN LEASES. WITH RESPECT TO 777 MAIN STREET, THE REMAINING TERM OF THE JACOBS
ENGINEERING LEASE HAS BEEN EXCLUDED, AS IT IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 31, 2013. 


(4)
IN-PLACE YIELD IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE PROJECTED ANNUAL NET OPERATING INCOME (OR NOI) FOR AN INDIVIDUAL ASSET (ALL BUILDINGS, IF APPLICABLE) BY THE
PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE ASSET. NOI IS CALCULATED AS THE BUDGETED CONTRACTUAL RENTAL AND OTHER INCOME FROM EXISTING LEASES AND OTHER BUDGETED CONTRACTS (WITHOUT ANY ASSUMPTIONS FOR NEW LEASES OR OTHER CONTRACTS) FOR THE 12 MONTH PERIOD FROM JULY 1,
2013 TO JUNE 30, 2014, LESS THE BUDGETED EXPENSES FOR THE SAME PERIOD, AND IS THEN ADJUSTED FOR ABOVE OR BELOW MARKET LEASES AND STRAIGHTLINING OF RENT OVER THE PERIOD IN QUESTION. WITH RESPECT TO 777 MAIN STREET, EXCLUDES REMAINING INCOME FROM THE
JACOBS ENGINEERING LEASE, TOTALING $419,000, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 31, 2013. 


(5)
PROJECTED OCCUPANCY AT YEAR END IS APPROXIMATELY 72% DUE TO UPCOMING LEASE EXPIRATIONS EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2013, INCLUDING THE REDUCTION OF THE JACOBS
ENGINEERING LEASE FROM APPROXIMATELY 333,000 SQUARE FEET TO APPROXIMATELY 68,000 SQUARE FEET.  RATIONALE FOR TEXAS
ACQUISITION  THE TEXAS ACQUISITION REPRESENTS AN ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BUY TWO HIGH QUALITY OFFICE ASSETS THAT
ARE CONCENTRATED IN OUR TARGET MARKETS THAT ACCELERATES OUR STRATEGIC PLANS. WE BELIEVE THE TEXAS ACQUISITION WILL CREATE STRATEGIC, PORTFOLIO AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 
 


 

 
 TRANSFORMATIVE ACQUISITION CONSISTENT WITH OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY. GREENWAY PLAZA AND 777 MAIN STREET ARE TOP QUALITY OFFICE ASSETS LOCATED
WITHIN HIGH GROWTH URBAN SUBMARKETS. GREENWAY PLAZA IS CENTRALLY LOCATED BETWEEN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT AND THE GALLERIA SUBMARKETS OF HOUSTON, TEXAS, AND 777 MAIN STREET IS LOCATED WITHIN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT OF FORT WORTH,
TEXAS. THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE TEXAS ACQUISITIONS REFLECTS A SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNT TO THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF REPLACEMENT COST FOR THESE ASSETS. WE BELIEVE THE TEXAS ACQUISITION PORTFOLIO PROVIDES AN EMBEDDED OPPORTUNITY FOR NET OPERATING
INCOME GROWTH THROUGH (I) REPLACING BELOW-MARKET IN-PLACE RENTS WITH MARKET RENTS, (II) THE LEASE-UP OF VACANT SPACE AND (III) DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. 
  4 




 

 
 SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS OPERATING PLATFORM IN TEXAS. FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION, IF CONSUMMATED, AND ASSUMING COMPLETION OF
THE ANTICIPATED EXISTING PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT NO INDIVIDUAL METROPOLITAN AREA WILL COMPRISE MORE THAN 37% OF OUR TOTAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO (BASED ON RENTABLE SQUARE FOOTAGE), A DECREASE FROM A 51%
CONCENTRATION IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION. IN ADDITION, THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE OUR LOCAL RECOGNITION AS AN OWNER AND OPERATOR OF HIGH QUALITY OFFICE PROPERTIES IN TEXAS, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL INCREASE OUR
EXPOSURE TO NEW TRANSACTION OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING LEASING, ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.   


 

 
 BENEFITS OF SCALE. THE TEXAS ACQUISITION WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR ASSET BASE WITHOUT, WE BELIEVE, ANY ADDITIONAL G&A EXPENSE. IN
ADDITION, THE TEXAS ACQUISITION AND THE OFFERING WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE PUBLIC FLOAT OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 
FINANCING OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION  WE EXPECT A DELAY BETWEEN THE CLOSING OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION AND THE COMPLETION OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR EXISTING PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND OUR INCURRENCE OF NEW SECURED PROPERTY-LEVEL DEBT. AS A RESULT,
WE ANTICIPATE AN INITIAL INCREASE IN OUR LEVERAGE RATIO DUE TO THE FUNDING OF A PORTION OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN AT THE CLOSING DATE. HOWEVER, AS WE REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER OUR TERM LOAN WITH THE NET
PROCEEDS FROM OUR ANTICIPATED PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS, WE EXPECT OUR TOTAL LEVERAGE (DEFINED AS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY TOTAL DEBT PLUS MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND LIQUIDATION VALUE OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK) TO ULTIMATELY DECREASE TO
APPROXIMATELY 29%, ASSUMING ALL PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS ARE COMPLETED AS ANTICIPATED AND ASSUMING THE COMPLETION OF THE OFFERING AND THE EXERCISE IN FULL OF THE UNDERWRITERS OPTION TO PURCHASE 9 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES IN THE OFFERING.
 WE INTEND TO FUND A PORTION OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION THROUGH THE PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR NET PROCEEDS
FROM THESE DISPOSITIONS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION. OUR SHARE OF THE ANNUALIZED NOI FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013 FROM THESE ANTICIPATED DISPOSITIONS WAS APPROXIMATELY $15.7 MILLION. THIS ESTIMATE REFLECTS SALES PRICES FOR THOSE
PROPERTIES WE HAVE ALREADY CONTRACTED TO SELL (THE AVENUE MURFREESBORO AND TIFFANY SPRINGS MARKETCENTER) AND OUR OWN ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL SALES PRICES FOR ASSETS CURRENTLY BEING MARKETED OR EXPECTED TO BE MARKETED. WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE THE
AVENUE MURFREESBORO, TIFFANY SPRINGS MARKETCENTER AND CP VENTURE FIVE LLC AND CP VENTURE TWO LLC DISPOSITION TRANSACTIONS BY SEPTEMBER 30, 2013, DEPENDING ON MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS; HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO
COMPLETE ANY OF THESE DISPOSITIONS IN THE AMOUNTS TARGETED, IN THE TIME PERIOD EXPECTED, OR AT ALL.  WE EXPECT TO INCUR
SECURED PROPERTY-LEVEL DEBT BY PLACING MORTGAGES ON TWO OF OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES, PROMENADE, A 775,000 SQUARE FOOT CLASS-A OFFICE BUILDING LOCATED IN THE MIDTOWN SUBMARKET OF ATLANTA, GEORGIA, AND POST OAK CENTRAL, A 1.3 MILLION SQUARE FOOT
CLASS-A OFFICE COMPLEX IN THE GALLERIA SUBMARKET OF HOUSTON, TEXAS. WE ANTICIPATE REALIZING NET CASH PROCEEDS IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $272 MILLION FROM THESE MORTGAGES. WE INTEND TO CLOSE THESE LOANS BY SEPTEMBER 30, 2013,
SUBJECT TO SATISFACTION OF CUSTOMARY FUNDING CONDITIONS; HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CLOSE THESE LOANS IN THE AMOUNTS TARGETED, IN THE TIME PERIOD EXPECTED, OR AT ALL. 
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES  WE MAY FAIL TO CONSUMMATE THE TEXAS ACQUISITION, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 
WE INTEND TO USE A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE OFFERING TO FUND A PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE TEXAS
ACQUISITION. THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THOSE CONDITIONS WILL BE SATISFIED OR THAT WE WILL COMPLETE THIS ACQUISITION ON THE TERMS DESCRIBED HEREIN OR AT ALL. IN THE EVENT THAT WE FAIL
TO COMPLETE THE TEXAS ACQUISITION, WE WILL HAVE ISSUED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WITHOUT REALIZING A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW FROM ACQUIRING THE PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, WE WILL HAVE BROAD
AUTHORITY TO USE THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE OFFERING FOR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE REDEMPTION OF ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK, THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OFFICE PROPERTIES, OTHER
OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS AND THE 
  5 



REPAYMENT OF DEBT THAT MAY NOT BE ACCRETIVE TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, OUR FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THE TEXAS ACQUISITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE OUR ANTICIPATED PROPERTY
DISPOSITIONS, RESULTING IN HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED LEVELS OF INDEBTEDNESS.  WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO
COMPLETE OUR ANTICIPATED PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND INCUR NEW SECURED PROPERTY-LEVEL DEBT OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING FOR THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IN THE AMOUNTS TARGETED, IN THE TIME PERIOD EXPECTED, ON ATTRACTIVE TERMS, OR AT
ALL, WHICH COULD RESULT IN GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN.  OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE
DILUTION AS A RESULT OF THE OFFERING, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PER SHARE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  THE
OFFERING MAY HAVE A DILUTIVE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS PER SHARE AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE ISSUANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OFFERING AND THE RECEIPT OF THE EXPECTED NET PROCEEDS. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF DILUTION
FROM THE OFFERING, OR FROM ANY FUTURE OFFERING OF COMMON OR PREFERRED STOCK, WILL BE BASED ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, PARTICULARLY THE USE OF PROCEEDS AND ANY RETURN GENERATED THEREBY, AND CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME. THE PER SHARE TRADING PRICE OF
OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE AS A RESULT OF SALES OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE MARKET IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING, OR OTHERWISE, OR AS A RESULT OF THE PERCEPTION OR EXPECTATION THAT SUCH SALES COULD OCCUR. 
AS A RESULT OF THE ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS INCURRED TO CONSUMMATE THE TEXAS ACQUISITION, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A POTENTIAL MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IS NOT SUBJECT TO A FINANCING
CONDITION. WE PLAN TO FUND THE CASH PURCHASE PRICE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING, CASH ON HAND FROM THE DISPOSITION OF EXISTING OWNED PROPERTIES, NEW SECURED PROPERTY-LEVEL DEBT AND, ON AN INTERIM BASIS, FUNDS DRAWN UNDER
THE TERM LOAN. FUNDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, WOULD BE PROVIDED IN A SINGLE DRAW-DOWN CONCURRENTLY WITH THE CLOSING OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION, WITH THE INITIAL AMOUNT OF THE TERM LOAN LIMITED TO THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE TEXAS
ACQUISITION AND RELATED TRANSACTION EXPENSES NOT FUNDED BY THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE OFFERING, THE PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND NEW SECURED PROPERTY-LEVEL DEBT. OUR INCURRENCE OF NEW INDEBTEDNESS COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS:
  


 

 
 REQUIRING US TO USE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE AVAILABLE CASH FLOW TO
FUND WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES AND REDUCE CASH FOR DISTRIBUTIONS;   


 

 
 LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, ACQUISITIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OTHER DEBT SERVICE
REQUIREMENTS OR FOR OTHER PURPOSES;   


 

 
 INCREASING THE COSTS OF INCURRING ADDITIONAL DEBT;   


 

 
 INCREASING OUR EXPOSURE TO FLOATING INTEREST RATES;   


 

 
 LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES WHO ARE NOT AS HIGHLY LEVERAGED, AS WE MAY BE LESS CAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND
INDUSTRY CONDITIONS;   


 

 
 RESTRICTING US FROM MAKING STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOPING PROPERTIES OR EXPLOITING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES; 
 


 

 
 RESTRICTING THE WAY IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING COVENANTS IN THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR EXISTING AND FUTURE
INDEBTEDNESS;   


 

 
 EXPOSING US TO POTENTIAL EVENTS OF DEFAULT (IF NOT CURED OR WAIVED) UNDER COVENANTS CONTAINED IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS; 
  6 




 

 
 INCREASING OUR VULNERABILITY TO A DOWNTURN IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND 
 


 

 
 LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO REACT TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. 
THE IMPACT OF ANY OF THESE POTENTIAL ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
LIQUIDITY.  WE WILL INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES AND PAYMENTS EVEN IF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IS NOT COMPLETED. 
WE HAVE INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND OTHER COSTS AND OUR MANAGEMENT HAS DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE TIME AND
EFFORT IN CONNECTION WITH THE TEXAS ACQUISITION. IF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IS NOT COMPLETED, WE WILL BEAR CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TEXAS ACQUISITION WITHOUT REALIZING THE BENEFITS OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION. THE FEES AND EXPENSES
MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE CLOSING OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IS NOT
CONDITIONED UPON THE CLOSING OF THE OFFERING. THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS COLLECTIVELY PROVIDE FOR THE FORFEITURE OF OUR $30 MILLION DEPOSIT OF EARNEST MONEY IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO CONSUMMATE THE TEXAS ACQUISITION OTHER THAN FOR THE FAILURE OF
CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. THE FORFEITURE OF OUR $30 MILLION DEPOSIT OF EARNEST MONEY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR LIQUIDITY.  THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION MAY NOT BE REALIZED, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND
OUR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS.  WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RISKS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE ANTICIPATED
BENEFITS OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION, EVEN IF THE TRANSACTION IS CONSUMMATED. UPON COMPLETION OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION, WE EXPECT TO INTEGRATE THE PROPERTIES WE ACQUIRE WITH OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE INTEGRATION
SMOOTHLY, SUCCESSFULLY OR WITHIN ANTICIPATED COST ESTIMATES. THE DIVERSION OF OUR MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS TO THESE INTEGRATION EFFORTS, AND ANY DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED, COULD PREVENT US FROM REALIZING THE FULL
BENEFITS ANTICIPATED TO RESULT FROM THE TEXAS ACQUISITION AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ADDITIONAL RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS: 
 


 

 
 THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE OPERATIONS, MAINTAIN CONSISTENT STANDARDS, CONTROLS, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, OR REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED
BENEFITS OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION WITHIN THE ANTICIPATED TIMEFRAME OR AT ALL;   


 

 
 THE INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MONITOR AND MANAGE OUR EXPANDED PORTFOLIO OF PROPERTIES, RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES OR ATTRACT HIGHLY QUALIFIED NEW EMPLOYEES;
  


 

 
 THE PROJECTIONS OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REVENUES, COST SAVINGS OR OPERATING METRICS THAT WE DEVELOP DURING THE DUE DILIGENCE AND INTEGRATION PLANNING
PROCESS MIGHT BE INACCURATE;   


 

 
 THE POSSIBLE DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED ASSETS OR THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK; 
 


 

 
 UNANTICIPATED ISSUES, EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE AFTER THE DATE HEREOF; 
 


 

 
 DIVERSION OF OUR MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AWAY FROM OTHER BUSINESS CONCERNS; AND 
 


 

 
 EXPOSURE TO ANY UNDISCLOSED OR UNKNOWN POTENTIAL LIABILITIES RELATING TO THE TEXAS ACQUISITION. 
WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATION WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING DIFFICULTIES OR THAT ANY SUCH DIFFICULTIES WILL NOT HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. FAILURE TO REALIZE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 
  7 


WE WILL INCREASE OUR CONCENTRATION OF PROPERTIES IN THE TEXAS MARKET AS A RESULT OF THE TEXAS
ACQUISITION, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS IF THE MARKET IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC OR OTHER CONDITIONS.  AS A RESULT OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION, WE WILL INCREASE OUR CONCENTRATION OF PROPERTIES IN THE TEXAS MARKET. IF THE TEXAS MARKET IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LOCAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (SUCH AS
BUSINESS LAYOFFS, INDUSTRY SLOWDOWNS, CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND OTHER FACTORS) OR LOCAL REAL ESTATE CONDITIONS (SUCH AS OVERSUPPLY OF OR REDUCED DEMAND FOR OFFICE PROPERTIES), SUCH CONDITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON JULY 29, 2013, COUSINS PROPERTIES INCORPORATED (THE COMPANY, WE, US OR OUR) FILED A CURRENT REPORT ON


 
A PURCHASE AND SALE CONTRACT (THE GREENWAY PURCHASE AGREEMENT) WITH CRESCENT CROWN GREENWAY PLAZA SPV, LLC, CRESCENT CROWN SEVEN GREENWAY SPV, LLC, CRESCENT CROWN NINE GREENWAY SPV, LLC, AND CRESCENT CROWN
EDLOE GARAGE SPV, LLC, AFFILIATES OF CRESCENT REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS, LLC (SELLER), TO PURCHASE GREENWAY PLAZA, A 10-BUILDING, APPROXIMATELY 4.4 MILLION SQUARE FOOT OFFICE COMPLEX IN HOUSTON, TEXAS, FOR APPROXIMATELY $950 MILLION,
BEFORE ADJUSTMENT FOR BROKERS FEES, TRANSFER TAXES, AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING COSTS, AND   


 

 
A PURCHASE AND SALE CONTRACT (THE 777 MAIN PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND TOGETHER WITH THE GREENWAY PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS) WITH MS CRESCENT ONE SPV, LLC, AN AFFILIATE OF SELLER, TO
PURCHASE 777 MAIN STREET, AN APPROXIMATELY 980,000 SQUARE FOOT CLASS A OFFICE BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN FORT WORTH, TEXAS, FOR APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION, BEFORE ADJUSTMENT FOR BROKERS FEES, TRANSFER TAXES, AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING COSTS.
 WE REFER TO THE ACQUISITION OF THESE PROPERTIES AS THE TEXAS ACQUISITION. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MATERIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WAS INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 1.01 OF THE CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K FILED ON JULY 29, 2013, AND THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WERE FILED AS EXHIBITS 2.1 AND 2.2 THERETO, AND SUCH DESCRIPTION AND EXHIBITS ARE INCORPORATED

APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION, REDUCED BY CERTAIN CREDITS FOR TENANT IMPROVEMENTS, LEASING COMMISSIONS, STANDARD INCOME AND EXPENSE PRORATIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $45.5 MILLION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF
THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  THE SOURCES OF CASH TO FUND THE PURCHASE PRICE INCLUDED: (1) APPROXIMATELY $907.1 MILLION IN NET PROCEEDS FROM (A) OUR
COMMON STOCK OFFERING THAT WAS COMPLETED ON AUGUST 5, 2013, (B) THE DISPOSITION OF OUR INTEREST IN THE AVENUE MURFREESBORO, A 752,000-SQUARE-FOOT OPEN-AIR RETAIL CENTER IN SUBURBAN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, WHICH SALE CLOSED ON AUGUST 12,
2013, (C) PROPERTY-LEVEL DEBT FINANCINGS ON POST OAK CENTRAL, A 1.3 MILLION SQUARE FOOT CLASS-A OFFICE COMPLEX IN THE GALLERIA SUBMARKET OF HOUSTON, TEXAS, AND PROMENADE, A 775,000 SQUARE FOOT CLASS-A OFFICE BUILDING LOCATED IN THE MIDTOWN
SUBMARKET OF ATLANTA, GEORGIA, WHICH DEBT FINANCINGS CLOSED ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2013; (2) APPLICATION OF THE AGGREGATE $30 MILLION EARNEST MONEY DEPOSIT PREVIOUSLY MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS; AND
(3) APPROXIMATELY $129.1 MILLION DRAWN UNDER OUR EXISTING $350 MILLION CREDIT FACILITY.  IN THE JULY 29, 2013 CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K, WE
ALSO DISCLOSED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO A LOAN AGREEMENT WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. (JPM) AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. WHICH WOULD PERMIT US TO DRAW UP TO $950 MILLION UNDER A NEW TERM LOAN FACILITY, WITH AN ACCORDION FEATURE PERMITTING
US TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE BY UP TO $150 MILLION IF WE REQUESTED AND RECEIVED ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE INCREASE, FOR AN AGGREGATE AVAILABLE FACILITY AMOUNT UP TO $1.1 BILLION (THE TERM LOAN). BECAUSE WE ELECTED NOT TO DRAW
DOWN ON THE TERM LOAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION, AND BECAUSE THE TERM LOAN SPECIFIES THAT ANY UNUSED COMMITMENTS FOR THE TERM LOAN WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE TERMINATED IF THE TEXAS ACQUISITION IS CLOSED WITHOUT USE OF THE

THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE IS PROVIDED TO UPDATE THE DISCLOSURE CONTAINED IN THE SECTION SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS OF THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT, DATED OCTOBER 31, 2012, OF CORPORATE OFFICE PROPERTIES TRUST.
 
MEDICARE TAX ON UNEARNED INCOME.  FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2013, CERTAIN U.S. SHAREHOLDERS THAT ARE INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES OR TRUSTS MUST PAY AN ADDITIONAL 3.8% TAX ON, AMONG OTHER TYPES OF INVESTMENT INCOME, DIVIDENDS ON AND CAPITAL GAINS FROM THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF STOCK. PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF COMMON SHARES ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE EFFECT OF THESE RULES IN THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
CHANGES TO TAX RATES.  BECAUSE WE QUALIFY AS A REIT, DISTRIBUTIONS MADE TO OUR U.S. SHAREHOLDERS OUT OF OUR EARNINGS AND PROFITS WILL GENERALLY CONSTITUTE DIVIDENDS TAXABLE AS ORDINARY INCOME EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS ARE DESIGNATED AS CAPITAL GAINS. UNDER RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION, THE HIGHEST MARGINAL INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATE ON ORDINARY INCOME IS 39.6%, THE HIGHEST INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATE APPLICABLE TO LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS AND QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME IS 20%, AND THE RATE APPLIED FOR PURPOSES OF BACKUP WITHHOLDING IS 28%.
 
GUIDANCE RELATING TO FOREIGN ACCOUNTS.  ON JANUARY 17, 2013, THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE FOREIGN ACCOUNT TAX COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS OF THE HIRING INCENTIVES TO RESTORE EMPLOYMENT ACT (KNOWN AS FATCA) WHICH WAS ENACTED IN MARCH OF 2010. FATCA GENERALLY IMPOSES A 30% WITHHOLDING TAX ON DIVIDENDS ON, AND GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF, COPTS SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS, INCLUDING OUR COMMON SHARES, IF PAID TO A FOREIGN ENTITY UNLESS (I) IF THE FOREIGN ENTITY IS A FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, THE FOREIGN ENTITY UNDERTAKES CERTAIN DUE DILIGENCE, REPORTING, WITHHOLDING, AND CERTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, (II) IF THE FOREIGN ENTITY IS NOT A FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, THE FOREIGN ENTITY IDENTIFIES CERTAIN OF ITS U.S. INVESTORS, OR (III) THE FOREIGN ENTITY ESTABLISHES THAT IT IS OTHERWISE EXCEPTED UNDER FATCA. IF THE PAYEE IS A FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (THAT IS NOT OTHERWISE EXEMPT), IT MUST EITHER ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT REQUIRING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT IT UNDERTAKE TO IDENTIFY ACCOUNTS HELD BY CERTAIN UNITED STATES PERSONS OR UNITED STATES-OWNED FOREIGN ENTITIES, ANNUALLY REPORT CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH ACCOUNTS, AND WITHHOLD 30% ON PAYMENTS TO ACCOUNT HOLDERS WHOSE ACTIONS PREVENT IT FROM COMPLYING WITH THESE REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS, OR IN THE CASE OF A FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT IS RESIDENT IN A JURISDICTION THAT HAS ENTERED INTO AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT TO IMPLEMENT THIS LEGISLATION, COMPLY WITH THE REVISED DILIGENCE AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS OF SUCH INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT. WITHHOLDING IS REQUIRED (I) WITH RESPECT TO DIVIDENDS ON THE COMMON SHARES BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2014, AND (II) WITH RESPECT TO GROSS PROCEEDS FROM A SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF THE COMMON SHARES THAT OCCURS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2017.
 
IF WITHHOLDING IS REQUIRED UNDER FATCA ON A PAYMENT RELATED TO THE COMMON SHARES, INVESTORS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO WITHHOLDING (OR THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO A REDUCED RATE OF WITHHOLDING) ON SUCH PAYMENT GENERALLY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SEEK A REFUND OR CREDIT FROM THE IRS TO OBTAIN THE BENEFIT OF SUCH EXEMPTION OR REDUCTION (PROVIDED THAT SUCH BENEFIT IS AVAILABLE). WE WILL NOT PAY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO SHAREHOLDERS IN RESPECT OF ANY AMOUNTS WITHHELD. AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND AN APPLICABLE FOREIGN COUNTRY, OR FUTURE TREASURY REGULATIONS OR OTHER GUIDANCE MAY MODIFY THE ABOVE DESCRIBED REQUIREMENTS AND EFFECTIVE DATES. THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION REPLACES AND SUPERSEDES THE FINAL TWO PARAGRAPHS UNDER FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS  TAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS  TAXATION OF FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS IN THE ACCOMPANYING PROSPECTUS. PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF COMMON SHARES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE EFFECT OF FATCA IN THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

ITEM 2.06    MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTA NUMBER OF THE REGISTRANTS’ PROPERTIES SERVE AS COLLATERAL FOR A $147 MILLION NON RECOURSE LOAN (THE “DEBT”) AND HAVE AN ESTIMATED AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION (THE “COLLATERAL PROPERTIES”).  THE REGISTRANTS EXPECT THAT THE CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THE COLLATERAL PROPERTIES WILL BE INSUFFICIENT TO FUND DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS ON THE DEBT.  WHILE THE REGISTRANTS HAVE SOUGHT TO NEGOTIATE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES WITH THE LENDER OF THE DEBT, ON AUGUST 28, 2013, THE REGISTRANTS’ MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE OUTCOME WILL BE THE CONVEYANCE OF THE COLLATERAL PROPERTIES TO THE LENDER TO EXTINGUISH THE DEBT.  THE REGISTRANTS EXPECT THAT THE CONVEYANCE OF THE COLLATERAL PROPERTIES WILL OCCUR IN A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014.THE FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN OF THE COLLATERAL PROPERTIES IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO ARE LOWER THAN THEIR CARRYING VALUES, AND SUCH PROPERTIES THEREFORE ARE IMPAIRED (THE “IMPAIRED COLLATERAL PROPERTIES”).  AS A RESULT, IN CONNECTION WITH THE DETERMINATION REGARDING THE PROBABLE CONVEYANCE OF THE COLLATERAL PROPERTIES TO EXTINGUISH THE DEBT AND THE RESULTING SHORTENED HOLDING PERIOD FOR SUCH PROPERTIES, THE REGISTRANTS’ MANAGEMENT DETERMINED ON AUGUST 28, 2013 THAT THE REGISTRANTS WILL RECOGNIZE NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION, REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THE IMPAIRED COLLATERAL PROPERTIES EXCEED THEIR FAIR VALUES.  THE REGISTRANTS ALSO EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE GAINS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $74 MILLION, REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE DEBT WILL EXCEED THE ADJUSTED CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THE COLLATERAL PROPERTIES, UPON THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF THE DEBT.  THE REGISTRANTS DO NOT EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL MATERIAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVEYANCE OF THE COLLATERAL PROPERTIES.  AS THE DEBT IS NON RECOURSE TO THE REGISTRANTS, NO FURTHER LOSS IS EXPECTED AFTER CONVEYANCE OF THE COLLATERAL PROPERTIES.THE REGISTRANTS ARE ALSO IN CONTINUING NEGOTIATIONS TO SELL OTHER PROPERTIES IN COLORADO SPRINGS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE (THE “SALE PROPERTIES”).  AS A RESULT OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS, THE REGISTRANTS’ MANAGEMENT ALSO DETERMINED ON AUGUST 28, 2013 THAT THEY WILL RECOGNIZE NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION TO ADJUST THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE SALE PROPERTIES TO THEIR EXPECTED FAIR VALUES LESS COSTS TO SELL.  THE REGISTRANTS DO NOT EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL MATERIAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISPOSITION OF THE SALE PROPERTIES.  ITEM 7.01    REGULATION FD DISCLOSURETHE REGISTRANTS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED GUIDANCE FOR CORPORATE OFFICE PROPERTIES TRUST’S DILUTED EPS OF BETWEEN $0.15 AND $0.17 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2013 AND BETWEEN $0.21 AND $0.26 FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013.  ADJUSTING SOLELY FOR THE EFFECT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON THE IMPAIRED COLLATERAL PROPERTIES AND THE SALE PROPERTIES, THE REGISTRANTS HAVE MODIFIED THEIR GUIDANCE FOR CORPORATE OFFICE PROPERTIES TRUST’S DILUTED EPS TO BETWEEN ($0.02) AND $0.00 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2013 AND BETWEEN $0.04 AND $0.09 FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013.

ON JULY 31, 2013, LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST (THE COMPANY) AND LIBERTY PROPERTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP) ENTERED INTO A PARTNERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT) WITH CABOT INDUSTRIAL VALUE FUND III, INC., A MARYLAND CORPORATION, AND CABOT INDUSTRIAL VALUE FUND III MANAGER, LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, A MASSACHUSETTS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (TOGETHER, THE CABOT SELLERS) TO ACQUIRE (THE CABOT ACQUISITION) 100% OF THE OUTSTANDING GENERAL PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF THE CABOT INDUSTRIAL VALUE FUND III OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P., A DELAWARE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (CABOT).  THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE ACQUISITION IS $1.475 BILLION, WHICH WILL BE PAID THROUGH THE ASSUMPTION OF APPROXIMATELY $230 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE DEBT WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 5.85% AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF SEVEN YEARS AND THE REMAINDER IN CASH.  WE PLAN TO FUND THE CASH PORTION OF THE ACQUISITION CONSIDERATION, IN ADDITION TO NET TRANSACTION COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $7 MILLION AND PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION, THROUGH A COMBINATION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM AN EQUITY OFFERING AND BORROWINGS UNDER A $470 MILLION UNSECURED TERM LOAN (THE NEW TERM LOAN), WHICH WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING.  ON AN INTERIM BASIS, TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT PROCEEDS TO FUND THE CABOT ACQUISITION IN THE EVENT THAT FUNDS FROM THE SOURCES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE NOT RECEIVED BY THE CLOSING, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A COMMITMENT LETTER FOR A $1.27 BILLION BRIDGE LOAN FACILITY (THE BRIDGE LOAN).  WE ALSO INTEND TO SELL CERTAIN OPERATING PROPERTIES, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL GENERATE APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS.  INCLUDED IN THE $7 MILLION REFERENCED ABOVE ARE FEES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ASSUMPTION OF OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE DEBT, THE NEW TERM LOAN AND THE BRIDGE LOAN.
 
UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE CABOT ACQUISITION, WE WILL ACQUIRE A 100% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN 177 HIGH QUALITY INDUSTRIAL ASSETS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 23 MILLION SQUARE FEET AT A PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $64 PER SQUARE FOOT.  THESE ASSETS ARE LOCATED IN 24 MARKETS.  BASED ON SQUARE FOOTAGE, APPROXIMATELY 58% OF THE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED IN OUR EXISTING MARKETS AND APPROXIMATELY 42% OF THE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED IN MARKETS THAT ARE NEW TO US, INCLUDING ATLANTA, DALLAS/FORT WORTH AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, WHICH COMBINED COMPRISE 21% OF CABOTS SQUARE FEET.
 
WE AND THE CABOT SELLERS HAVE MADE CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT. THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT EITHER WE OR THE CABOT SELLERS MAY TERMINATE THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT IF THE ACQUISITION HAS NOT OCCURRED BY OCTOBER 16, 2013, SUBJECT TO EXTENSION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (PROVIDED THAT THIS RIGHT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO A PARTY WHOSE FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT OR BREACH OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS/WARRANTIES UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THE FAILURE TO CLOSE ON OR BEFORE THIS DATE). THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS CERTAIN TERMINATION RIGHTS FOR US AND THE CABOT SELLERS INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OUR ABILITY TO TERMINATE THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE CABOT ACQUISITION, IN WHICH CASE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO FORFEIT OUR SIGNING DEPOSIT OF $25 MILLION. IN ADDITION, IF WE BREACH THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE CABOT ACQUISITION AND THE CABOT SELLERS TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO FORFEIT OUR $25 MILLION SIGNING DEPOSIT. FURTHER, PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE CABOT ACQUISITION, IN THE EVENT THAT THE CABOT SELLERS BREACH THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE MAY TERMINATE THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT OR SEEK SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.
 
THE CABOT SELLERS HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY US FOR THEIR BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND/OR WARRANTIES, BREACH OF COVENANT AND/OR AGREEMENT IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND FOR PRE-CLOSING LIABILITIES AND TAXES OF CABOT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THEIR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION DOES NOT ARISE UNTIL THE LOSSES SUFFERED BY US EXCEED $350,000. THE CABOT SELLERS MAXIMUM AGGREGATE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION IS $10 MILLION TO BE PAID FROM AN INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW ACCOUNT.  TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR INDEMNIFICATION, OUR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIM MUST BE FIRST ASSERTED NO LATER THAN THE DATE THAT IS NINE MONTHS AFTER THE ACQUISITION CLOSING DATE. WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THE CABOT SELLERS FOR OUR BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND/OR WARRANTIES AND BREACH OF COVENANT AND/OR AGREEMENT IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT.  OUR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION DOES NOT ARISE UNTIL THE LOSSES SUFFERED BY CABOT SELLERS EXCEED $350,000.  OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNT IS $10 MILLION. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR INDEMNIFICATION, THE CABOT SELLERS INDEMNIFICATION CLAIM MUST BE FIRST ASSERTED NO LATER THAN THE DATE THAT IS NINE MONTHS AFTER THE ACQUISITION CLOSING DATE.  AFTER THE ACQUISITION CLOSING DATE, INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS ARE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR US AND THE CABOT SELLERS WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT OTHER THAN SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OR CLAIMS FOR FRAUD.
 
THE CABOT ACQUISITION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE DURING OCTOBER 2013, IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (A) OBTAINING ANY REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS (IF ANY) AND CERTAIN LENDER CONSENTS, (B) THE

AMENDED AND RESTATED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
 
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2013, SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST, OR THE COMPANY, AND REIT MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH LLC, OR REIT MANAGEMENT, AGREED TO RESTRUCTURE THE BASE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES PAYABLE TO REIT MANAGEMENT UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 11, 2012, BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND REIT MANAGEMENT, OR THE PREEXISTING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  ON DECEMBER 23, 2013, THE COMPANY AND REIT MANAGEMENT ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, OR THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED THE PREEXISTING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  THE AMENDMENTS CONTAINED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES PERFORMED ON AND AFTER JANUARY 1, 2014 AND TO FEES DUE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SERVICES, AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PREEXISTING MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT CONTINUE IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES PERFORMED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2014 AND TO FEES DUE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SERVICES.
 
THE TERM OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT CONTINUES UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2014.  THEREAFTER, THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS FOR SUCCESSIVE ONE YEAR TERMS ANNUALLY UNLESS NOTICE OF NON-RENEWAL IS GIVEN BY THE COMPANY OR REIT MANAGEMENT BEFORE THE END OF AN APPLICABLE TERM.  IN ADDITION, EITHER THE COMPANY OR REIT MANAGEMENT MAY TERMINATE THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT UPON 60 DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE FOR ANY REASON.
 
THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE PREEXISTING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT CONTAINED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT:
 
MANAGEMENT FEES
 
THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT REVISES THE CALCULATION OF THE ANNUAL BASE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT FEE, OR THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE, AND THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT FEE, OR THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE, PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY TO REIT MANAGEMENT.
 
UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE AMOUNT OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE TO BE PAID TO REIT MANAGEMENT BY THE COMPANY FOR EACH APPLICABLE PERIOD WILL BE EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF:
 
(I)                                     THE SUM OF (A) 0.5% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE AGGREGATE BOOK VALUE (BEFORE RESERVES FOR DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OR BAD DEBTS OR OTHER SIMILAR NONCASH ITEMS), AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, OF THE ASSETS OWNED BY THE COMPANY AS OF OCTOBER 12, 1999, OR THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS, PLUS (B) 0.7% OF THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL COST (BEFORE RESERVES FOR DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OR BAD DEBTS OR OTHER SIMILAR NONCASH ITEMS), AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, OF THE COMPANYS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS EXCLUDING THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS, OR THE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL, UP TO $250,000,000, PLUS (C) 0.5% OF THE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL EXCEEDING $250,000,000; AND
 
(II)                                  THE SUM OF (A) 0.7% OF THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE PER COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY, OR A COMMON SHARE, ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, OR THE NYSE, DURING SUCH PERIOD, MULTIPLIED BY THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING SUCH PERIOD, PLUS THE DAILY WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF EACH CLASS OF THE COMPANYS PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING SUCH PERIOD, PLUS THE DAILY WEIGHTED
 





 
AVERAGE OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED INDEBTEDNESS DURING SUCH PERIOD, OR THE AVERAGE MARKET CAPITALIZATION, UP TO $250,000,000, PLUS (B) 0.5% OF THE AVERAGE MARKET CAPITALIZATION EXCEEDING $250,000,000.
 
THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE PAID MONTHLY TO REIT MANAGEMENT 90% IN CASH AND 10% IN COMMON SHARES.  THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES TO BE ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE FOR EACH MONTH WILL BE EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF 10% OF THE TOTAL BASE MANAGEMENT FEE FOR THAT MONTH DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE DAILY CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMMON SHARES DURING THAT MONTH.  SUCH COMMON SHARES WILL BE FULLY VESTED UPON ISSUANCE.
 
THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WHICH MAY BE EARNED BY REIT MANAGEMENT FOR AN ANNUAL PERIOD WILL BE AN AMOUNT, NOT IN EXCESS OF THE CAP (AS DEFINED BELOW), EQUAL TO 12% OF THE PRODUCT OF (A) THE EQUITY MARKET CAPITALIZATION (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND (B) THE AMOUNT (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) BY WHICH THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE (AS DEFINED BELOW) DURING THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT PERIOD (AS DEFINED BELOW) EXCEEDS THE BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE (AS DEFINED BELOW) OR THE ADJUSTED BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE (AS DEFINED BELOW), IF APPLICABLE, FOR THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT PERIOD, AS REDUCED BY THE LOW RETURN FACTOR (AS DEFINED BELOW), IF APPLICABLE, IN THE CASE OF THE ADJUSTED BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE.  FOR PURPOSES OF THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE:
 
BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE MEANS THE CUMULATIVE PERCENTAGE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE SNL INDEX (AS DEFINED BELOW) FOR THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT PERIOD, BUT NOT LESS THAN ZERO, PROVIDED IF THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE IS IN EXCESS OF 12% PER YEAR IN ANY MEASUREMENT PERIOD, THE BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE FOR SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD WILL BE THE LESSER OF THE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE SNL INDEX FOR SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND 12% PER YEAR, OR THE ADJUSTED BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE, ALL DETERMINED ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS AFTER THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT PERIOD (I.E., 12%  PER YEAR MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND THE CUMULATIVE SNL INDEX);
 
CAP MEANS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES WHICH WOULD, AFTER ISSUANCE, REPRESENT 1.5% OF THE COMMON SHARES THEN OUTSTANDING MULTIPLIED BY THE FINAL SHARE PRICE (AS DEFINED BELOW) FOR THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE COMMON SHARES ARE TO BE ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE;
 
EQUITY MARKET CAPITALIZATION MEANS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FIRST YEAR OF ANY MEASUREMENT PERIOD MULTIPLIED BY THE INITIAL SHARE PRICE (AS DEFINED BELOW) FOR SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD;
 
FINAL SHARE PRICE MEANS, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MEASUREMENT PERIOD, THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMMON SHARES ON THE NYSE ON THE TEN CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS HAVING THE HIGHEST AVERAGE CLOSING PRICES DURING THE FINAL 30 TRADING DAYS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD;
 
INITIAL SHARE PRICE MEANS THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMMON SHARES ON THE NYSE ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FIRST YEAR OF ANY MEASUREMENT PERIOD, EXCEPT THAT, WITH RESPECT TO CALCULATION OF THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE IN THE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE INITIAL SHARE PRICE MEANS THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMMON SHARES ON THE NYSE ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013;
 
LOW RETURN FACTOR MEANS, WHERE THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE AMOUNT (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) BY WHICH THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE IS IN EXCESS OF THE ADJUSTED BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE, A REDUCTION IN THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE IF THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE IS BETWEEN 200 BASIS POINTS AND 500 BASIS POINTS BELOW THE SNL INDEX IN
 
2





 
ANY YEAR; IF THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE IS 500 BASIS POINTS BELOW THE SNL INDEX IN ANY YEAR, THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE REDUCED TO ZERO, AND IF THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE IS BELOW THE SNL INDEX BY MORE THAN 200 BASIS POINTS, BUT NO MORE THAN 500 BASIS POINTS, IN ANY YEAR, THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE REDUCED BY A PERCENTAGE DETERMINED BY LINEAR INTERPOLATION BETWEEN 200 AND 500, DETERMINED ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT PERIOD (I.E., BETWEEN 200 BASIS POINTS AND 500 BASIS POINTS PER YEAR MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND BELOW THE CUMULATIVE SNL INDEX);
 
MEASUREMENT PERIOD MEANS, INITIALLY, THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014; FOR THE YEAR BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015, THE CONSECUTIVE TWO YEAR PERIOD INCLUDING THE THEN CURRENT YEAR AND THE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR YEAR; AND FOR THE YEAR BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016, AND THEREAFTER, A CONSECUTIVE THREE YEAR PERIOD INCLUDING THE THEN CURRENT YEAR AND THE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TWO YEARS;
 
SNL INDEX MEANS THE SNL REIT HEALTHCARE INDEX AS PUBLISHED FROM TIME TO TIME (OR A SUCCESSOR INDEX INCLUDING A COMPARABLE UNIVERSE OF UNITED STATES PUBLICLY TRADED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS); AND
 
TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE OF THE HOLDERS OF COMMON SHARES WILL BE DETERMINED ANNUALLY AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR AND MEANS A PERCENTAGE DETERMINED BY SUBTRACTING THE INITIAL SHARE PRICE FOR THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT PERIOD FROM THE SUM OF THE FINAL SHARE PRICE FOR SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD, PLUS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED IN RESPECT OF A COMMON SHARE DURING SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD, AND DIVIDING THE RESULT BY SUCH INITIAL SHARE PRICE.
 
THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE IS PAYABLE IN COMMON SHARES.  THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES TO BE ISSUED WILL EQUAL THE VALUE OF THE APPLICABLE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE DIVIDED BY THE FINAL SHARE PRICE.  ONE THIRD OF THE COMMON SHARES ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF AN INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE VESTED ON THE DATE OF ISSUANCE, AND THE REMAINING TWO THIRDS WILL VEST IN TWO EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS.
 
IF ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES ARE ISSUED DURING A MEASUREMENT PERIOD, THE COMPUTATION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE (AS WELL AS THE DETERMINATIONS OF TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE, EQUITY MARKET CAPITALIZATION AND INITIAL SHARE PRICE) WILL GIVE EFFECT TO SUCH ISSUANCES.
 
IF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE RESTATED DUE TO MATERIAL NON-COMPLIANCE WITH ANY FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS AS A RESULT OF REIT MANAGEMENTS BAD FAITH, WILLFUL OR WANTON MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FOR ONE OR MORE PERIODS IN RESPECT OF WHICH REIT MANAGEMENT RECEIVED AN INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE, THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE PAYABLE WITH RESPECT TO PERIODS FOR WHICH THERE HAS BEEN A RESTATEMENT SHALL BE RECALCULATED BY, AND APPROVED BY A MAJORITY VOTE OF, THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES IN LIGHT OF SUCH RESTATEMENT, AND REIT MANAGEMENT, AT ITS ELECTION, WILL BE REQUIRED EITHER TO RETURN TO THE COMPANY ANY COMMON SHARES IN EXCESS OF THOSE THAT IT WOULD HAVE RECEIVED BASED UPON THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE AS RECALCULATED OR TO REIMBURSE THE COMPANY IN CASH FOR THE VALUE OF SUCH COMMON SHARES.
 
IN GENERAL, THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE AND INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE PRO RATED AS PROVIDED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT IN THE EVENT OF A TERMINATION OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  UPON ANY TERMINATION OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, ALL COMMON SHARES PREVIOUSLY ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEES SHALL BE FULLY VESTED AS OF THE DATE OF TERMINATION, UNLESS THE TERMINATION WAS BY THE COMPANY AND WAS DUE TO REIT MANAGEMENT HAVING ACTED IN BAD FAITH, HAVING ENGAGED IN WILLFUL OR WANTON MISCONDUCT OR BEING GROSSLY NEGLIGENT, IN WHICH CASE UNVESTED COMMON SHARES ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEES ARE REQUIRED TO BE FORFEITED, AND NO INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE DUE IN THE YEAR OF TERMINATION.
 
3





 
IF THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON SHARES IN PAYMENT OF A PORTION OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OR INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WOULD BE LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND REGULATIONS, SUCH PORTION OF THE APPLICABLE FEE TO BE PAID IN COMMON SHARES WHICH MAY NOT BE PAID BY ISSUANCE OF COMMON SHARES IS INSTEAD REQUIRED TO BE PAID IN CASH.
 
REIT MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN ELIGIBLE TRANSFEREES OF COMMON SHARES ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OR INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE ARE ENTITLED TO DEMAND REGISTRATION RIGHTS, EXERCISABLE NOT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN TWICE PER YEAR, AND TO PIGGY-BACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS RELATING TO COMMON SHARES ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OR INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE, AT THE EXPENSE OF REIT MANAGEMENT OR THE APPLICABLE ELIGIBLE TRANSFEREE.  IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH REGISTRATION OF SUCH COMMON SHARES FOR RESALE, THE COMPANY AND APPLICABLE SELLING SHAREHOLDERS AGREE PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY EACH OTHER (AND THEIR OFFICERS, TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS AND CONTROLLING PERSONS) AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LIABILITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED.
 
OTHER CHANGES
 
THE PREEXISTING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDED IN GENERAL THAT, IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES TO OFFER FOR SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION ARRANGEMENT ANY REAL PROPERTY THAT, AT SUCH TIME, IS OF A TYPE WITHIN A PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT FOCUS OF ANOTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST TO WHICH REIT MANAGEMENT AT SUCH TIME PROVIDES BUSINESS MANAGEMENT OR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES, THAT OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST WOULD HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS OF FIRST OFFER TO ACQUIRE SUCH PROPERTY.  THAT RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER HAS BEEN REMOVED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT REIT MANAGEMENT MAY ENGAGE IN OTHER ACTIVITIES OR BUSINESSES AND ACT AS THE MANAGER TO ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY (INCLUDING OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS) EVEN THOUGH SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY HAS INVESTMENT POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE COMPANY AND THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT ENTITLED TO PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT IN RECEIVING INFORMATION, RECOMMENDATIONS AND OTHER SERVICES FROM REIT MANAGEMENT.  MESSRS. BARRY PORTNOY, ADAM PORTNOY AND GERARD MARTIN WERE REMOVED AS PARTIES TO THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND, ACCORDINGLY, SO WERE THE PROVISIONS FROM THE PREEXISTING MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT THAT SPECIFICALLY APPLIED TO THEM.
 
THE TERMS OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE REVIEWED, APPROVED AND ADOPTED BY THE COMPANYS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, WHICH IS COMPRISED SOLELY OF INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.  IN ADDITION, AS PART OF ITS REVIEW OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE RECEIVED ADVICE FROM AN INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT.  THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTION OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT IS NOT COMPLETE AND IS SUBJECT TO AND QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 10.1 HERETO AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
 
OVERVIEW
 
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
EARLIER DETERMINED TO SHIFT FROM ITS PAST PRACTICE OF MAKING EQUITY GRANTS EVERY THREE YEARS FOR SEQUENTIAL “END-TO-END”
GRANT CYCLES (I.E., 2008-2010, 2011-2013) TO ANNUAL GRANTS FOR “ROLLING THREE-YEAR” GRANT CYCLES (I.E., 2014-2016,
2015-2017, 2016-2018). ACCORDINGLY, RATHER THAN MAKING A SINGLE ROUND OF EQUITY AWARDS FOR THE 2014-2016 PERFORMANCE CYCLE WITH
NO ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS UNTIL 2017, THE COMMITTEE DETERMINED TO IMPLEMENT A NEW LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
PROGRAM EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014 WITH SMALLER ANNUAL GRANTS THAN PREVIOUS GRANTS MADE EVERY THREE YEARS. AS OF NOVEMBER 15, 2013,
THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE APPROVED THE GRANT, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014, OF LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS TO EACH OF
THE OFFICERS AS THE FIRST GRANT UNDER THE NEW ANNUAL ROLLING THREE YEAR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM. AS OF NOVEMBER
15, 2013, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ALSO APPROVED THE GRANT, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2013, OF ONE-TIME TRANSITION AWARDS TO EACH
OF THE OFFICERS TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOST COMPENSATION OPPORTUNITY THAT THE OFFICERS WOULD OTHERWISE
SUFFER
 

4
 

 
IN OMEGA’S TRANSITION IN 2014 FROM THE THREE-YEAR END-TO-END LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM TO THE ANNUAL
ROLLING THREE-YEAR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM. EACH GRANT IS SUBJECT TO THE OFFICER’S CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT
THROUGH THE APPLICABLE GRANT DATE.
 
THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OMEGA COMMON STOCK
ISSUABLE UNDER THE ANNUAL GRANTS AND THE TRANSITION GRANTS ARE BASED ON PROJECTED AGGREGATE ACCRUED TAXABLE INCOME POTENTIALLY
REALIZABLE BY EACH OFFICER, RATHER THAN THE ESTIMATED COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO BE RECOGNIZED BY OMEGA UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING
PRINCIPLES (“GAAP”). OMEGA EXPECTS THAT THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANNUAL AND TRANSITION GRANTS UNDER
GAAP WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN PROJECTED AGGREGATE ACCRUED TAXABLE INCOME REALIZABLE BY THE OFFICERS. PROJECTED AGGREGATE
ACCRUED TAXABLE INCOME INCLUDES PROJECTED DIVIDENDS AND REFLECTS POTENTIAL ACCRUED TAXABLE INCOME AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF OMEGA’S
PERFORMANCE AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
 
THE SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE
COMPENSATION GRANTS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW. THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENT BELOW ASSUMES THAT THE OFFICER HAS NOT ELECTED
TO DEFER RECEIPT OF THE COMMON STOCK OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS UNDER OMEGA’S DEFERRED STOCK PLAN.
 
ONE-TIME TRANSITION GRANTS EFFECTIVE
DECEMBER 31, 2013.
 
THE PROJECTED AGGREGATE ACCRUED
TAXABLE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION OPPORTUNITY (INCLUDING DIVIDENDS) FOR EACH OFFICER UNDER THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION GRANTS
OF TIME-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (“RSUS”) AND PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (“PRSUS”) FOR THE
PERIOD FROM DECEMBER 31, 2013 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2016 IS NOTED IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE THRESHOLD, TARGET AND HIGH LEVELS OF LONG-TERM
INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARE BASED IN PART ON TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN (“TSR”) PERFORMANCE AND RELATIVE TSR PERFORMANCE
FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. TSR IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE TOTAL AGGREGATE CHANGE IN OMEGA’S STOCK PRICE PER SHARE
OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD PLUS DIVIDENDS PER SHARE DECLARED WITH RESPECT TO THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. RELATIVE TSR MEANS OMEGA’S
TSR AS COMPARED TO THE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN REPORTED FOR THE MSCI U.S. REIT INDEX FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. FOR CALCULATING
TSR AND RELATIVE TSR, THE STARTING AND ENDING STOCK PRICES USED ARE THE NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE PER SHARE AT
THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIODS.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF OPERATING REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES OF CABOT INDUSTRIAL VALUE FUND III OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, AND THE RELATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT.
 
MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT
 
MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF THE STATEMENT OF OPERATING REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; THIS INCLUDES THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND MAINTENANCE OF INTERNAL CONTROL RELEVANT TO THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF THE STATEMENT OF OPERATING REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES THAT ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT, WHETHER DUE TO FRAUD OR ERROR.
 
AUDITORS RESPONSIBILITY
 
OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE STATEMENT OF OPERATING REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUDITING STANDARDS GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE STATEMENT OF OPERATING REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES IS FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT.
 
AN AUDIT INVOLVES PERFORMING PROCEDURES TO OBTAIN AUDIT EVIDENCE ABOUT THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATING REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES. THE PROCEDURES SELECTED DEPEND ON THE AUDITORS JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT OF THE STATEMENT OF OPERATING REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES, WHETHER DUE TO FRAUD OR ERROR. IN MAKING THOSE RISK ASSESSMENTS, THE AUDITOR CONSIDERS INTERNAL CONTROL RELEVANT TO THE ENTITYS PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF THE STATEMENT OF OPERATING REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES IN ORDER TO DESIGN AUDIT PROCEDURES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPRESSING AN OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ENTITYS INTERNAL CONTROL. ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPRESS NO SUCH OPINION. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES EVALUATING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED AND THE REASONABLENESS OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL PRESENTATION OF THE STATEMENT OF OPERATING REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES.
 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE AUDIT EVIDENCE WE HAVE OBTAINED IS SUFFICIENT AND APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR OUR AUDIT OPINION.

AMENDED AND RESTATED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
 
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2013, HOSPITALITY PROPERTIES TRUST, OR THE COMPANY, AND REIT MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH LLC, OR REIT MANAGEMENT, AGREED TO RESTRUCTURE THE BASE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES PAYABLE TO REIT MANAGEMENT UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 10, 2012, BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND REIT MANAGEMENT, OR THE PREEXISTING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  ON DECEMBER 23, 2013, THE COMPANY AND REIT MANAGEMENT ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, OR THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED THE PREEXISTING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  THE AMENDMENTS CONTAINED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES PERFORMED ON AND AFTER JANUARY 1, 2014 AND TO FEES DUE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SERVICES, AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PREEXISTING MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT CONTINUE IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES PERFORMED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2014 AND TO FEES DUE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SERVICES.
 
THE TERM OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT CONTINUES UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2014.  THEREAFTER, THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS FOR SUCCESSIVE ONE YEAR TERMS ANNUALLY UNLESS NOTICE OF NON-RENEWAL IS GIVEN BY THE COMPANY OR REIT MANAGEMENT BEFORE THE END OF AN APPLICABLE TERM.  IN ADDITION, EITHER THE COMPANY OR REIT MANAGEMENT MAY TERMINATE THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT UPON 60 DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE FOR ANY REASON.
 
THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE PREEXISTING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT CONTAINED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT:
 
MANAGEMENT FEES
 
THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT REVISES THE CALCULATION OF THE ANNUAL BASE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT FEE, OR THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE, AND THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT FEE, OR THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE, PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY TO REIT MANAGEMENT.
 
UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE AMOUNT OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE TO BE PAID TO REIT MANAGEMENT BY THE COMPANY FOR EACH APPLICABLE PERIOD WILL BE EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF:
 
(I)                                     THE SUM OF (A) 0.7% OF THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL COST (BEFORE RESERVES FOR DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OR BAD DEBTS OR OTHER SIMILAR NONCASH RESERVES) OF THE CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF THE COMPANY DURING SUCH PERIOD, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, OR THE  AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL, OF THE COMPANYS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS UP TO $250,000,000, PLUS (B) 0.5% OF THE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL OF THE COMPANYS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS EXCEEDING $250,000,000; AND
 
(II)                                  THE SUM OF (A) 0.7% OF THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE PER COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY, OR A COMMON SHARE, ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, OR THE NYSE, DURING SUCH PERIOD, MULTIPLIED BY THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING SUCH PERIOD, PLUS THE DAILY WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF EACH CLASS OF THE COMPANYS PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING SUCH PERIOD, PLUS THE DAILY WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED INDEBTEDNESS DURING SUCH PERIOD, OR THE AVERAGE MARKET CAPITALIZATION, UP TO $250,000,000, PLUS (B) 0.5% OF THE AVERAGE MARKET CAPITALIZATION EXCEEDING $250,000,000.
 
2





 
THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE PAID MONTHLY TO REIT MANAGEMENT 90% IN CASH AND 10% IN COMMON SHARES.  THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES TO BE ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE FOR EACH MONTH WILL BE EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF 10% OF THE TOTAL BASE MANAGEMENT FEE FOR THAT MONTH DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE DAILY CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMMON SHARES DURING THAT MONTH.  SUCH COMMON SHARES WILL BE FULLY VESTED UPON ISSUANCE.
 
THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WHICH MAY BE EARNED BY REIT MANAGEMENT FOR AN ANNUAL PERIOD WILL BE AN AMOUNT, NOT IN EXCESS OF THE CAP (AS DEFINED BELOW), EQUAL TO 12% OF THE PRODUCT OF (A) THE EQUITY MARKET CAPITALIZATION (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND (B) THE AMOUNT (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) BY WHICH THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE (AS DEFINED BELOW) DURING THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT PERIOD (AS DEFINED BELOW) EXCEEDS THE BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE (AS DEFINED BELOW) OR THE ADJUSTED BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE (AS DEFINED BELOW), IF APPLICABLE, FOR THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT PERIOD, AS REDUCED BY THE LOW RETURN FACTOR (AS DEFINED BELOW), IF APPLICABLE, IN THE CASE OF THE ADJUSTED BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE.  FOR PURPOSES OF THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE:
 
BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE MEANS THE CUMULATIVE PERCENTAGE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE SNL INDEX (AS DEFINED BELOW) FOR THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT PERIOD, BUT NOT LESS THAN ZERO, PROVIDED IF THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE IS IN EXCESS OF 12% PER YEAR IN ANY MEASUREMENT PERIOD, THE BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE FOR SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD WILL BE THE LESSER OF THE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE SNL INDEX FOR SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND 12% PER YEAR, OR THE ADJUSTED BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE, ALL DETERMINED ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS AFTER THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT PERIOD (I.E., 12%  PER YEAR MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND THE CUMULATIVE SNL INDEX);
 
CAP MEANS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES WHICH WOULD, AFTER ISSUANCE, REPRESENT 1.5% OF THE COMMON SHARES THEN OUTSTANDING MULTIPLIED BY THE FINAL SHARE PRICE (AS DEFINED BELOW) FOR THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE COMMON SHARES ARE TO BE ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE;
 
EQUITY MARKET CAPITALIZATION MEANS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FIRST YEAR OF ANY MEASUREMENT PERIOD MULTIPLIED BY THE INITIAL SHARE PRICE (AS DEFINED BELOW) FOR SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD;
 
FINAL SHARE PRICE MEANS, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MEASUREMENT PERIOD, THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMMON SHARES ON THE NYSE ON THE TEN CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS HAVING THE HIGHEST AVERAGE CLOSING PRICES DURING THE FINAL 30 TRADING DAYS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD;
 
INITIAL SHARE PRICE MEANS THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMMON SHARES ON THE NYSE ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FIRST YEAR OF ANY MEASUREMENT PERIOD, EXCEPT THAT, WITH RESPECT TO CALCULATION OF THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE IN THE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE INITIAL SHARE PRICE MEANS THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMMON SHARES ON THE NYSE ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013;
 
LOW RETURN FACTOR MEANS, WHERE THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE AMOUNT (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) BY WHICH THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE IS IN EXCESS OF THE ADJUSTED BENCHMARK RETURN PER SHARE, A REDUCTION IN THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE IF THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE IS BETWEEN 200 BASIS POINTS AND 500 BASIS POINTS BELOW THE SNL INDEX IN ANY YEAR; IF THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE IS 500 BASIS POINTS BELOW THE SNL INDEX IN ANY YEAR, THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE REDUCED TO ZERO, AND IF THE TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE IS BELOW THE SNL INDEX BY MORE THAN 200 BASIS POINTS, BUT NO MORE THAN 500 BASIS POINTS, IN ANY YEAR, THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE REDUCED BY A PERCENTAGE DETERMINED BY LINEAR INTERPOLATION
 
3





 
BETWEEN 200 AND 500, DETERMINED ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT PERIOD (I.E., BETWEEN 200 BASIS POINTS AND 500 BASIS POINTS PER YEAR MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND BELOW THE CUMULATIVE SNL INDEX);
 
MEASUREMENT PERIOD MEANS, INITIALLY, THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014; FOR THE YEAR BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015, THE CONSECUTIVE TWO YEAR PERIOD INCLUDING THE THEN CURRENT YEAR AND THE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR YEAR; AND FOR THE YEAR BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016, AND THEREAFTER, A CONSECUTIVE THREE YEAR PERIOD INCLUDING THE THEN CURRENT YEAR AND THE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TWO YEARS;
 
SNL INDEX MEANS THE SNL US REIT HOTEL INDEX AS PUBLISHED FROM TIME TO TIME (OR A SUCCESSOR INDEX INCLUDING A COMPARABLE UNIVERSE OF UNITED STATES PUBLICLY TRADED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS); AND
 
TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE OF THE HOLDERS OF COMMON SHARES WILL BE DETERMINED ANNUALLY AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR AND MEANS A PERCENTAGE DETERMINED BY SUBTRACTING THE INITIAL SHARE PRICE FOR THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT PERIOD FROM THE SUM OF THE FINAL SHARE PRICE FOR SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD, PLUS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED IN RESPECT OF A COMMON SHARE DURING SUCH MEASUREMENT PERIOD, AND DIVIDING THE RESULT BY SUCH INITIAL SHARE PRICE.
 
THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE IS PAYABLE IN COMMON SHARES.  THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES TO BE ISSUED WILL EQUAL THE VALUE OF THE APPLICABLE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE DIVIDED BY THE FINAL SHARE PRICE.  ONE THIRD OF THE COMMON SHARES ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF AN INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE VESTED ON THE DATE OF ISSUANCE, AND THE REMAINING TWO THIRDS WILL VEST IN TWO EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS.
 
IF ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES ARE ISSUED DURING A MEASUREMENT PERIOD, THE COMPUTATION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE (AS WELL AS THE DETERMINATIONS OF TOTAL RETURN PER SHARE, EQUITY MARKET CAPITALIZATION AND INITIAL SHARE PRICE) WILL GIVE EFFECT TO SUCH ISSUANCES.
 
IF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE RESTATED DUE TO MATERIAL NON-COMPLIANCE WITH ANY FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS AS A RESULT OF REIT MANAGEMENTS BAD FAITH, WILLFUL OR WANTON MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FOR ONE OR MORE PERIODS IN RESPECT OF WHICH REIT MANAGEMENT RECEIVED AN INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE, THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE PAYABLE WITH RESPECT TO PERIODS FOR WHICH THERE HAS BEEN A RESTATEMENT SHALL BE RECALCULATED BY, AND APPROVED BY A MAJORITY VOTE OF, THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES IN LIGHT OF SUCH RESTATEMENT, AND REIT MANAGEMENT, AT ITS ELECTION, WILL BE REQUIRED EITHER TO RETURN TO THE COMPANY ANY COMMON SHARES IN EXCESS OF THOSE THAT IT WOULD HAVE RECEIVED BASED UPON THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE AS RECALCULATED OR TO REIMBURSE THE COMPANY IN CASH FOR THE VALUE OF SUCH COMMON SHARES.
 
IN GENERAL, THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE AND INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE PRO RATED AS PROVIDED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT IN THE EVENT OF A TERMINATION OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  UPON ANY TERMINATION OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, ALL COMMON SHARES PREVIOUSLY ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEES SHALL BE FULLY VESTED AS OF THE DATE OF TERMINATION, UNLESS THE TERMINATION WAS BY THE COMPANY AND WAS DUE TO REIT MANAGEMENT HAVING ACTED IN BAD FAITH, HAVING ENGAGED IN WILLFUL OR WANTON MISCONDUCT OR BEING GROSSLY NEGLIGENT, IN WHICH CASE UNVESTED COMMON SHARES ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEES ARE REQUIRED TO BE FORFEITED, AND NO INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WILL BE DUE IN THE YEAR OF TERMINATION.
 
IF THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON SHARES IN PAYMENT OF A PORTION OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OR INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE WOULD BE LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND REGULATIONS, SUCH PORTION OF THE APPLICABLE FEE TO BE PAID IN COMMON SHARES WHICH MAY NOT BE PAID BY ISSUANCE OF COMMON SHARES IS INSTEAD REQUIRED TO BE PAID IN CASH.
 
4





 
REIT MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN ELIGIBLE TRANSFEREES OF COMMON SHARES ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OR INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE ARE ENTITLED TO DEMAND REGISTRATION RIGHTS, EXERCISABLE NOT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN TWICE PER YEAR, AND TO PIGGY-BACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS RELATING TO COMMON SHARES ISSUED IN PAYMENT OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OR INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE, AT THE EXPENSE OF REIT MANAGEMENT OR THE APPLICABLE ELIGIBLE TRANSFEREE.  IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH REGISTRATION OF SUCH COMMON SHARES FOR RESALE, THE COMPANY AND APPLICABLE SELLING SHAREHOLDERS AGREE PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY EACH OTHER (AND THEIR OFFICERS, TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS AND CONTROLLING PERSONS) AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LIABILITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED.
 
OTHER CHANGES
 
THE PREEXISTING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDED IN GENERAL THAT, IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES TO OFFER FOR SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION ARRANGEMENT ANY REAL PROPERTY THAT, AT SUCH TIME, IS OF A TYPE WITHIN A PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT FOCUS OF ANOTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST TO WHICH REIT MANAGEMENT AT SUCH TIME PROVIDES BUSINESS MANAGEMENT OR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES, THAT OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST WOULD HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS OF FIRST OFFER TO ACQUIRE SUCH PROPERTY.  THAT RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER HAS BEEN REMOVED IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  IN THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT REIT MANAGEMENT MAY ENGAGE IN OTHER ACTIVITIES OR BUSINESSES AND ACT AS THE MANAGER TO ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY (INCLUDING OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS) EVEN THOUGH SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY HAS INVESTMENT POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE COMPANY AND THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT ENTITLED TO PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT IN RECEIVING INFORMATION, RECOMMENDATIONS AND OTHER SERVICES FROM REIT MANAGEMENT.  MESSRS. BARRY PORTNOY, ADAM PORTNOY AND GERARD MARTIN WERE REMOVED AS PARTIES TO THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND, ACCORDINGLY, SO WERE THE PROVISIONS FROM THE PREEXISTING MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT THAT SPECIFICALLY APPLIED TO THEM.
 
THE TERMS OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE REVIEWED, APPROVED AND ADOPTED BY THE COMPANYS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, WHICH IS COMPRISED SOLELY OF INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.  IN ADDITION, AS PART OF ITS REVIEW OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE RECEIVED ADVICE FROM AN INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT.  THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTION OF THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT IS NOT COMPLETE AND IS SUBJECT TO AND QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE AMENDED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 10.1 HERETO AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

ON FEBRUARY 10, 2014, SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST, OR WE, OUR OR US, ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT, OR THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, TO ACQUIRE TWO BIOTECH MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS FROM FIFTY NORTHERN AVENUE LLC AND ELEVEN FAN PIER BOULEVARD LLC FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.125 BILLION.  THESE 15-STORY BUILDINGS, WHICH COMPRISE PRINCIPALLY BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH FACILITIES AND CORPORATE OFFICE SPACE AND ALSO INCLUDE STRUCTURED PARKING AND STREET-LEVEL RETAIL SPACE, CONTAIN 1.65 MILLION TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AND ARE LOCATED IN THE SEAPORT DISTRICT OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.  THE BUILDINGS ARE CURRENTLY 96% LEASED TO VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED FOR A REMAINING LEASE TERM OF APPROXIMATELY 15 YEARS.
 
THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT CONTAINS CERTAIN CLOSING CONDITIONS TYPICAL OF LARGE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS, AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL THOSE CONDITIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WILL BE SATISFIED.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION OF THESE TWO BUILDINGS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2014.  HOWEVER, THE CLOSING COULD BE DELAYED OR MAY NOT OCCUR AT ALL, AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION WILL NOT CHANGE.
 
IN CONNECTION WITH ENTERING INTO THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE RECEIVED A COMMITMENT FOR AN UNSECURED TERM LOAN OF UP TO $800.0 MILLION FROM JEFFERIES FINANCE, LLC AND WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A.  THE TERM LOAN IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE CONCURRENTLY WITH THE CLOSING OF OUR ACQUISITION OF THE TWO BUILDINGS, TO HAVE AN INTEREST RATE OF LIBOR PLUS 140 BASIS POINTS (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT, AND SUBJECT TO FLEX PROVISIONS THAT WOULD ADJUST THE LENDERS YIELD TO MARKET CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF SYNDICATION), TO BE PREPAYABLE IN PART OR WHOLE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PENALTY AND TO MATURE FIVE YEARS FROM CLOSING.  WE EXPECT THAT, PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF THESE TWO BUILDINGS, THE TERM LOAN WILL BE SYNDICATED TO A GROUP OF LENDERS.  THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF THE TERM LOAN THAT WE BORROW MAY BE LESS THAN $800 MILLION, WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS TO US, DEPENDING ON OUR FUNDING NEEDS AT THE TIME OF CLOSING.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO FUND THE ACQUISITION OF THE TWO BUILDINGS INITIALLY USING CASH ON HAND, PROCEEDS OF THE TERM LOAN AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR $750.0 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  WE PLAN TO LONG TERM FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF THE TWO BUILDINGS WITH A MIX OF DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL, DEPENDING ON THE COST OF SUCH FINANCING AND MARKET CONDITIONS.
 
THE COMMITMENTS WHICH WE RECEIVED FOR THE TERM LOAN ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY DOCUMENTATION.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL THOSE CONDITIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WILL BE SATISFIED, THAT THE TERMS OF THE TERM LOAN DESCRIBED IN THE COMMITMENTS WILL NOT CHANGE, OR THAT THE TERM LOAN WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US TIMELY OR AT ALL.  IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, OUR FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE OF THE TWO BUILDINGS, INCLUDING BY REASON OF OUR INABILITY TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION, WILL RESULT IN OUR FORFEITURE OF A $50 MILLION DEPOSIT.  THE UNAVAILABILITY OF FINANCING FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE BUILDINGS ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR ANY DELAY IN OBTAINING THIS FINANCING OR IN COMPLETING THIS PURCHASE COULD PREVENT US FROM REALIZING THE OVERALL BENEFITS THAT WE EXPECT FROM THE PURCHASE.
 
THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTION OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS NOT COMPLETE AND IS SUBJECT TO AND QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS FILED AS EXHIBIT 2.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

AGREEMENT.
ON DECEMBER 27, 2013, OMEGA
HEALTHCARE INVESTORS, INC. (“OMEGA”) ENTERED INTO A NEW $200 MILLION SENIOR UNSECURED, DEFERRED DRAW, TERM LOAN FACILITY
(THE “2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY”). THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY MATURES ON FEBRUARY 29, 2016.
 
THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY
IS BEING PROVIDED PURSUANT TO A CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2013 (THE “2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT”), AMONG
OMEGA, AS BORROWER, CERTAIN OF OMEGA’S SUBSIDIARIES IDENTIFIED IN THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS GUARANTORS, BANK OF AMERICA,
N.A., AS THE INITIAL LENDER (TOGETHER WITH OTHER LENDERS FROM TIME TO TIME BECOMING SIGNATORY TO THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS
LENDERS, THE “2013 TERM LENDERS”), AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR THE 2013 TERM LENDERS. OMEGA’S
OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY GUARANTEED BY OMEGA’S CURRENT SUBSIDIARIES
(OTHER THAN THOSE DESIGNATED AS “UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES”) FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE 2013
TERM LENDERS. ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARIES CREATED OR ACQUIRED BY OMEGA IN THE FUTURE (UNLESS DESIGNATED AS UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES)
WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE OMEGA’S OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY, IF SUCH FUTURE SUBSIDIARIES
OWN UNENCUMBERED REAL PROPERTY OR GUARANTEE OTHER UNSECURED FUNDED DEBT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO OMEGA’S UNSECURED SENIOR
NOTES AND OMEGA’S 2012 SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN FACILITIES).
 
NO BORROWINGS HAVE YET
BEEN MADE BY OMEGA UNDER THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY. PROCEEDS OF FUTURE SUCH BORROWINGS MAY BE USED ONLY TO FINANCE GENERAL CORPORATE
WORKING CAPITAL (INCLUDING REPAYMENT OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS, ASSET ACQUISITIONS, ACQUIRING OR IMPROVING INCOME PRODUCING HEALTHCARE
FACILITIES, AND INVESTMENTS INCIDENTAL OR RELATED TO SUCH PURPOSES), CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES OF OMEGA
AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES THAT GUARANTEE THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY. OMEGA CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES DRAWING ON THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY
EARLY IN 2014 TO REPAY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OMEGA’S 2012 SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.
 
FROM TIME TO TIME, CERTAIN
OF THE 2013 TERM LENDERS, THEIR AFFILIATES AND/OR THEIR PREDECESSORS HAVE PROVIDED COMMERCIAL BANKING, INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER
FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES TO OMEGA OR SERVED AS UNDERWRITERS OR SALES AGENTS FOR OFFERINGS OF OMEGA’S EQUITY OR DEBT, FOR
WHICH THEY HAVE RECEIVED CUSTOMARY FEES. SUCH SERVICES HAVE INCLUDED AFFILIATES OF CERTAIN OF THE 2013 TERM LENDERS SERVING AS
LENDERS UNDER OMEGA’S 2012 SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN FACILITIES. ASSUMING OMEGA REPAYS BORROWINGS UNDER
OMEGA’S 2012 SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY,
SUCH LENDERS WOULD RECEIVE A PORTION OF SUCH PROCEEDS. AFFILIATES OF CERTAIN OF THE 2013 TERM LENDERS HAVE SERVED AS SALES AGENTS
UNDER OMEGA’S AT-THE-MARKET EQUITY SHELF PROGRAM. THE 2013 TERM LENDERS AND THEIR AFFILIATES MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE
FUTURE, ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AND PERFORM SERVICES FOR OMEGA IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.
 
THE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE
2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 
TERM LOAN ADVANCES
AND REPAYMENT. SUBJECT TO ITS SATISFACTION OF CUSTOMARY DRAWING CONDITIONS, OMEGA HAS THE RIGHT TO DRAW UNDER THE 2013 TERM
LOAN FACILITY UP TO THREE TIMES UNTIL FEBRUARY 28, 2014, OR UNTIL SUCH EARLIER DATE AS THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY HAS BEEN FULLY
ADVANCED OR IS TERMINATED (THE “TERM LOAN COMMITMENT PERIOD”). ANY UNDRAWN PORTION OF THE TERM LOAN COMMITMENT WILL
TERMINATE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THE TERM LOAN COMMITMENT PERIOD AND CEASE TO BE AVAILABLE. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT ADVANCED UNDER
THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY DOES NOT AMORTIZE, AND IS DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL ON FEBRUARY 29, 2016.

INTEREST RATES
AND FEES. THE INTEREST RATES PER ANNUM APPLICABLE TO THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY ARE (A) THE RESERVE ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE

(B) THE BASE RATE, PLUS THE APPLICABLE MARGIN (AS DESCRIBED BELOW), WITH THE BASE RATE BEING EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST OF (I) THE
RATE OF INTEREST PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AS ITS PRIME RATE IN EFFECT, (II) THE FEDERAL FUNDS EFFECTIVE
RATE FROM TIME TO TIME PLUS 0.50% AND (III) THE EURODOLLAR RATE DETERMINED ON SUCH DAY FOR A EURODOLLAR LOAN WITH AN INTEREST PERIOD
OF ONE MONTH PLUS 1.0%, IN EACH CASE. THE APPLICABLE MARGINS WITH RESPECT TO THE 2013 TERM LOAN
FACILITY ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH A PERFORMANCE GRID BASED ON OUR INVESTMENT GRADE RATINGS FROM STANDARD & POOR’S,
MOODY’S AND/OR FITCH RATINGS WITH RESPECT TO OMEGA’S NON-CREDIT-ENHANCED, SENIOR UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT. THE APPLICABLE
MARGIN FOR THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY MAY RANGE FROM 2.30% TO 1.10% IN THE CASE OF EURODOLLAR ADVANCES, AND FROM 1.30% TO 0.10%
IN THE CASE OF BASE RATE ADVANCES. THE DEFAULT RATE ON THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY IS 2.0% ABOVE THE INTEREST RATE OTHERWISE
APPLICABLE TO BASE RATE LOANS. WE ARE ALSO OBLIGATED TO PAY AN UNUSED FEE ON THE UNDRAWN PORTION OF THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY
TO THE 2013 TERM LENDERS EQUAL TO 0.30% PER ANNUM ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY DURING THE TERM LOAN COMMITMENT
PERIOD.
PREPAYMENTS;
REDUCTION OR TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS. WE MAY PREPAY THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY AT ANY TIME IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OR REDUCE
OR TERMINATE THE TERM LOAN COMMITMENT UNDER THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY, IN EACH CASE WITHOUT FEES OR PENALTY. PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS
PREPAID OR REPAID UNDER THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY MAY NOT BE REBORROWED.

RIGHT TO INCREASE
MAXIMUM BORROWINGS. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS AND SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS OF THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE 2013 TERM LENDERS
HAVE AGREED THAT OMEGA MAY ADD ONE OR MORE INCREMENTAL TRANCHES OF TERM LOANS TO THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL
AMOUNT OF ALL SUCH INCREMENTAL TRANCHES OF TERM LOANS NOT TO EXCEED $200 MILLION.
GUARANTEES.
OMEGA’S CURRENT SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE NOT UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES UNDER THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

AT A MEETING HELD ON MARCH 17, 2014, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE COMMITTEE) OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES (THE BOARD) OF LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST (THE COMPANY) APPROVED THE LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST 2014 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2014 PLAN), WITH THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. THE 2014 PLAN IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR IN DESIGN TO THE LIBERTY PROPERTY TRUST 2013 THROUGH 2008 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS, IN THAT IT PROVIDES FOR AN ANNUAL AGGREGATE AWARD (EACH, AN AWARD) COMPOSED OF (I) A GRANT OF PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THE TOTAL TARGETED EXPECTED VALUE OF THE AWARD), AND (II) A GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS (APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE TOTAL TARGETED EXPECTED VALUE OF THE AWARD).  WHEN THE COMPANYS COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST, $0.001 PAR VALUE (THE COMMON SHARES), ARE ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO THE AWARDS THEY UNDERLIE, THEY WILL BE ISSUED UNDER THE COMPANYS AMENDED AND RESTATED SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN (THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN), AND SHALL GENERALLY BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THAT PLAN.
 
ALSO AT THE MARCH 17, 2014 MEETING, THE COMMITTEE APPROVED GRANTS UNDER THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN OF 10,735, 6,710 AND 6,710 RESTRICTED COMMON SHARES TO WILLIAM P. HANKOWSKY, GEORGE J. ALBURGER, JR. AND MICHAEL T. HAGAN, RESPECTIVELY. THESE GRANTS WERE IN RECOGNITION OF THE RECIPIENTS EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPLETION DURING 2013 OF SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE COMPANYS STRATEGY. THE RESTRICTIONS ON THESE SHARES WILL LAPSE IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON THE FIRST FIVE ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT, SUBJECT TO ACCELERATED VESTING UPON THE REPORTING PERSONS DEATH, DISABILITY OR (IN THE CASES OF THE AWARDS TO MESSRS. ALBURGER AND HAGAN) RETIREMENT (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN).
 
BOTH THE 2014 PLAN AND THE SEPARATE AWARDS TO MESSRS. HANKOWSKY, ALBURGER AND HAGAN ARE DESCRIBED BELOW IN MORE DETAIL.
 
2014 PLAN
 
AWARDS UNDER THE 2014 PLAN WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING GENERAL FEATURES:
 
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. A RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT (RSU) UNDER THE 2014 PLAN CONSISTS OF A LEGALLY-BINDING PROMISE TO PAY THE EXECUTIVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE COMMON SHARES AT THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD (AS DEFINED BELOW), TO THE EXTENT CERTAIN ANNUAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE MET OR EXCEEDED.
 
THE RSUS SHALL BE ELIGIBLE TO BE EARNED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD (THE AWARD PERIOD), AND SHALL BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO (I) A PORTION EARNED RATABLY OVER THE AWARD PERIOD ON A YEAR-BY-YEAR BASIS (EACH YEAR CONSTITUTING A RELATED PERFORMANCE PERIOD), USING A SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASURE (THE FIRST PORTION), AND (II) A PORTION EARNED OVER THE FULL AWARD PERIOD, USING ANOTHER SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASURE (THE SECOND PORTION). NEITHER PORTION,
 
1





 
HOWEVER, WOULD BE PAYABLE UNTIL THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR AWARD PERIOD. ANY DIVIDENDS THAT ACCUMULATE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD WILL BE PAID IF AND WHEN THE RELATED RSUS ARE REDEEMED AND PAID.
 
UNDER THE 2014 PLAN, THE COMMITTEE HAS THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE A WIDE VARIETY OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES ON WHICH TO BASE EACH PARTICULAR YEARS GRANT OF RSUS, AND WILL ACT EACH YEAR TO DESIGNATE THE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THAT YEAR. FOR THE AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE 2014 PLAN, AS DISCUSSED MORE SPECIFICALLY BELOW, THESE TWO MEASURES ARE BASED, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AS ADJUSTED IF APPROPRIATE) (THE FFO PORTION) FOR THE FIRST PORTION OF THE AWARD, AND ITS TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (THE TSR PORTION) AS COMPARED TO A RELEVANT PEER GROUP FOR THE SECOND PORTION OF THE AWARD. THE COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED A PERFORMANCE METRICS SCHEDULE FOR THE AWARDS TO BE GRANTED UNDER THE 2014 PLAN, LISTING THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH THE ACTUAL FFO PORTION AND TSR PORTION WILL ACCRUE, IN RELATION TO THE SPECIFIED TARGET LEVELS. THESE LEVELS PROVIDE FOR SPECIFIED AWARDS UPON ATTAINMENT OF STIPULATED PERCENTAGES OF THE TARGET LEVEL (AND INCLUDE A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES PAYABLE OF 200% (272% FOR OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER) OF BOTH THE FIRST PORTION AND THE SECOND PORTION), WITH THE COMMITTEE RETAINING DISCRETION TO REDUCE THE AWARD FROM THE PRESCRIBED LEVEL AS IT DEEMS FIT.
 
THE RSUS THAT COMPRISE THE FIRST PORTION WILL BE SPLIT INTO THREE EQUAL PIECES, CORRESPONDING TO EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE RELEVANT AWARD PERIOD. DEPENDING ON HOW EACH YEARS PERFORMANCE COMPARES TO TARGET PERFORMANCE FOR THAT YEAR USING AN ANNUALLY-DETERMINED PERFORMANCE SCHEDULE, A PORTION OF THE RELATED RSUS WILL BE DEEMED EARNED FOR THAT YEAR, AND WILL BE PAYABLE TO THE PARTICIPANT IN COMMON SHARES (UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN) AT THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD. THE RSUS THAT COMPRISE THE SECOND PORTION ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE EARNED ON THE BASIS OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN FOR THE RELEVANT AWARD PERIOD, USING A PERFORMANCE SCHEDULE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD. THE SECOND PORTION WILL BE DEEMED EARNED AND PAYABLE TO THE PARTICIPANT IN COMMON SHARES (UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN) AT THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD.
 
IF A RECIPIENT OF AN AWARD QUITS OR IS DISCHARGED FOR CAUSE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD, ALL RSUS WILL BE FORFEITED, EVEN IF THEY HAVE (IN THE CASE OF THE FIRST PORTION THAT ACCRUES ON A YEAR-BY-YEAR BASIS) ALREADY BEEN EARNED. IF THE RECIPIENT OF AN AWARD IS, INSTEAD, TERMINATED WITHOUT CAUSE, OR TERMINATES BY REASON OF DEATH, DISABILITY OR RETIREMENT (AS DEFINED IN THE SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN) PRIOR TO THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD, THE TREATMENT OF THE RSUS SHALL BE AS SET FORTH IN THE GRANT DOCUMENTS. THE 2014 PLAN ALSO INCLUDES SEVERAL COMMON CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUBJECT TO THE COMMITTEES DISCRETION, THAT WOULD TRIGGER FORFEITURE OF AN AWARD.
 
OPTIONS.  STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE 2014 PLAN WILL BE VESTED (AND THUS EXERCISABLE) SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF TIME AND CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT, WITH NO REGARD TO ANY PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AT A RATE OF 20% OF THE TOTAL OPTION COMPONENT AT THE END OF THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF GRANT, 30% ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY, AND THE REMAINDER ON THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY. IN ADDITION, THEY WILL BECOME IMMEDIATELY VESTED AND EXERCISABLE IN FULL IF THE OPTIONEE CEASES TO BE EMPLOYED BY, OR PROVIDE SERVICES TO, THE TRUST BY REASON OF DEATH OR DISABILITY OR, SUBJECT TO A SLIDING SCALE, RETIREMENT.  THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE, GENERALLY, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT CURRENTLY GOVERN OPTIONS GRANTED TO NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS PART OF THE COMPANYS LTI

RATIFIED CRITERIA PROPOSED BY ITS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE TO BE USED IN ESTABLISHING AN INCENTIVE BONUS POOL FROM WHICH AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED TO THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CERTAIN OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS UNDER THE
COMPANYS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN (THE 2014 EXECUTIVE OFFICER BONUS PLAN). AWARDS UNDER THE 2014 EXECUTIVE OFFICER BONUS PLAN WILL BE BASED ON CERTAIN IDENTIFIED THRESHOLDS OF FOUR PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES. THE CATEGORIES ARE
(I) FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO) PER SHARE (USING THE NAREIT DEFINITION), AS FFO MAY BE ADJUSTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IN ITS DISCRETION TO EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS, (II) SAME STORE NET
OPERATING INCOME (SS NOI) GROWTH, (III) FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO AND (IV) DISCRETIONARY OBJECTIVES (BASED ON FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL GOALS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER). THE COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE HAS ASSIGNED WEIGHTING FACTORS TO EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES, SUCH THAT PERFORMANCE IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES WILL HAVE A MORE PRONOUNCED IMPACT ON THE BONUS POOL UNDER THE 2014 EXECUTIVE OFFICER BONUS PLAN THAN WILL PERFORMANCE IN
OTHER CATEGORIES. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS ASSIGNED A 65% WEIGHTING FACTOR TO THE FFO PER SHARE CATEGORY, A 10% WEIGHTING FACTOR TO EACH OF THE SS NOI GROWTH AND FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO CATEGORIES, AND A 15% WEIGHTING FACTOR TO THE
DISCRETIONARY OBJECTIVES CATEGORY.  THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS ALSO ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE TARGETS AND THRESHOLDS RELATING TO EACH
PERFORMANCE CATEGORY. ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS WITH RESPECT TO EACH PERFORMANCE CATEGORY WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE INCENTIVE POOL FROM WHICH AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE 2014 EXECUTIVE OFFICER BONUS PLAN. ACHIEVEMENT BY THE
COMPANY OF SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO EACH PERFORMANCE CATEGORY WILL RESULT IN FUNDING OF THE INCENTIVE POOL FOR THE 2014 EXECUTIVE OFFICER BONUS PLAN OF 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% OR 125%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE BONUS
OPPORTUNITY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PERFORMANCE CATEGORY. SHOULD PERFORMANCE FALL BETWEEN TWO IDENTIFIED PAYOUT LEVELS, THE RESULTING COMPENSATION THAT MAY BE EARNED FOR SUCH PERFORMANCE WILL BE PRORATED BASED ON LINEAR INTERPOLATION.

ON JANUARY 8, 2014, HOSPITALITY PROPERTIES TRUST, OR WE OR US, AMENDED AND RESTATED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR $750.0 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND $400.0 MILLION TERM LOAN, OR, TOGETHER, THE CREDIT FACILITIES, WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND A SYNDICATE OF OTHER LENDERS.  AS OF THE DATE OF THE AMENDMENT, WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT AND $400.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN.
 
AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT, THE STATED MATURITY DATE OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WAS EXTENDED FROM SEPTEMBER 7, 2015 TO JULY 15, 2018 AND THE STATED MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOAN WAS EXTENDED FROM MARCH 13, 2017 TO APRIL 15, 2019.  SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT OF AN EXTENSION FEE AND MEETING CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS, WE ALSO HAVE AN OPTION TO FURTHER EXTEND THE STATED MATURITY DATE OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BY AN ADDITIONAL ONE YEAR.  THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT WE CAN BORROW, REPAY AND REBORROW FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY UNTIL MATURITY, AND NO PRINCIPAL REPAYMENT IS DUE UNTIL MATURITY.  THE $750.0 MILLION AMOUNT OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE $400.0 MILLION AMOUNT OF THE TERM LOAN REMAINED UNCHANGED BY THE AMENDMENT. THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES A FEATURE UNDER WHICH MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN MAY BE INCREASED TO UP TO $2.3 BILLION ON A COMBINED BASIS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT, THE INTEREST RATE PAID ON BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WAS REDUCED FROM LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM OF 130 BASIS POINTS TO LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM OF 110 BASIS POINTS, AND THE FACILITY FEE WAS REDUCED FROM 30 BASIS POINTS TO 20 BASIS POINTS PER ANNUM ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LENDING COMMITMENTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. ALSO AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT, THE INTEREST RATE PAID ON BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN WAS REDUCED FROM LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM OF 145 BASIS POINTS TO LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM OF 120 BASIS POINTS.  BOTH THE INTEREST RATE PREMIUMS AND THE FACILITY FEE ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT RATINGS.
 
OUR BORROWINGS UNDER THE AMENDED CREDIT FACILITIES CONTINUE TO BE UNSECURED.  PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AMENDMENT, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAD GUARANTEED OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN.  AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT, NONE OF THOSE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES REMAIN IN EFFECT.  THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, A SUBSIDIARY OF OURS IS REQUIRED TO GUARANTY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN ONLY IF THAT SUBSIDIARY HAS SEPARATELY INCURRED DEBT (OTHER THAN NONRECOURSE DEBT), WITHIN THE MEANING SPECIFIED IN THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT, OR PROVIDED A GUARANTEE OF DEBT INCURRED BY US OR ANY OF OUR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES.
 
THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTINUES TO PROVIDE FOR ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND CONTINUATION OF CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT, SUCH AS A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF US, WHICH INCLUDES REIT MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH LLC CEASING TO ACT AS OUR SOLE BUSINESS MANAGER.  THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO CONTINUES TO CONTAIN A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO INCUR DEBT IN EXCESS OF CALCULATED AMOUNTS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL RATIOS.

LETTER AGREEMENT WITH INTERCONTINENTAL
 
UNDER OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP, PLC, OR INTERCONTINENTAL, INTERCONTINENTAL IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A DEPOSIT TO SUPPORT ITS OBLIGATION TO PAY CERTAIN AMOUNTS TO US WITH RESPECT TO HOTELS WE OWN AND WHICH INTERCONTINENTAL MANAGES, INCLUDING THE OWNERS FIRST PRIORITY, WHICH OBLIGATIONS WE REFER TO AS MINIMUM RETURNS. INTERCONTINENTAL WILL NOT BE IN DEFAULT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TO PAY THE OWNERS FIRST PRIORITY IN FULL SO LONG AS, AFTER APPLYING PORTIONS OF THE DEPOSIT, THERE IS A MINIMUM DEPOSIT REMAINING.  WE WERE ADVISED BY INTERCONTINENTAL THAT IT ANTICIPATES POSSIBLE SEASONAL SHORTFALLS IN THE MINIMUM DEPOSIT REQUIRED TO BE MAINTAINED, DURING THE FISCAL YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2015.  AS A RESULT, ON JANUARY 6, 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A LETTER AGREEMENT WITH INTERCONTINENTAL UNDER WHICH THE MINIMUM DEPOSIT REQUIRED TO BE MAINTAINED DURING THE FISCAL YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2015 WOULD BE DEEMED TO BE REDUCED BY TWO DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR INTERCONTINENTAL SEPARATELY FUNDED TO US AS A SPECIAL DEPOSIT.  BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016, ANY DEEMED REDUCTIONS TO THE MINIMUM DEPOSIT WILL CEASE TO BE IN EFFECT AND THE MINIMUM DEPOSIT REQUIRED UNDER THE INTERCONTINENTAL AGREEMENT WILL RETURN TO $37 MILLION.

ALSO, WHENEVER WE USE WORDS SUCH AS BELIEVE, EXPECT, ANTICIPATE, INTEND, PLAN, ESTIMATE OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, WE ARE MAKING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS.  THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON OUR PRESENT INTENT, BELIEFS OR EXPECTATIONS, BUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR FOR VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING SOME REASONS WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE:
 
·                 THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K STATES THE AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  HOWEVER, CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SUBJECT TO OUR SATISFYING CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND MEETING OTHER CUSTOMARY CREDIT FACILITY CONDITIONS.

·                 THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K STATES THAT THE MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN MAY BE INCREASED TO UP TO $2.3 BILLION ON A COMBINED BASIS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.  INCREASING THE MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND OUR TERM LOAN IS SUBJECT TO OUR OBTAINING ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FROM LENDERS, WHICH MAY NOT OCCUR.
 
·                 THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K DISCUSSES THE INTEREST TO BE PAID ON BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN.  HOWEVER, ACTUAL COSTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN WILL BE HIGHER THAN LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM BECAUSE OF OTHER FEES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN.
 
·                 THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K DISCUSSES CHANGES TO OUR MINIMUM DEPOSIT ARRANGEMENT WITH INTERCONTINENTAL THAT WILL BE IN EFFECT DURING 2014 AND 2015.  THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K ALSO INDICATES THAT INTERCONTINENTAL HAS ADVISED US THAT IT ANTICIPATES POSSIBLE SEASONAL SHORTFALLS IN THE MINIMUM DEPOSIT REQUIRED TO BE MAINTAINED BY IT FOR 2014 AND 2015, WHICH MAY IMPLY THAT IT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE, OR WILL NOT REALIZE, SIMILAR OR OTHER SHORTFALLS FOLLOWING 2015.  HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT INTERCONTINENTAL WILL NOT EXPERIENCE SHORTFALLS IN FUTURE PERIODS, INCLUDING IN AMOUNTS GREATER THAN IT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES FOR 2014 AND 2015, OR OTHERWISE.  THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K ALSO STATES THAT THE MINIMUM DEPOSIT REQUIRED UNDER THE INTERCONTINENTAL AGREEMENT BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016 WILL RETURN TO $37 MILLION.  WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT INTERCONTINENTAL WILL BE ABLE TO FUND THIS SECURITY DEPOSIT IN FULL.  IN THE PAST AND CURRENTLY INTERCONTINENTAL HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PAY THE MINIMUM AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM ITS OPERATIONS OF OUR LEASED OR MANAGED PROPERTIES.  WE EXPECT THAT INTERCONTINENTAL WILL CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THE SECURITY DEPOSIT WE HOLD FOR ANY PAYMENT SHORTFALLS.  HOWEVER, THE SECURITY DEPOSIT WE HOLD FOR INTERCONTINENTALS OBLIGATIONS TO US IS FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT AND, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LETTER DESCRIBED HEREIN, MAY BE REDUCED DURING 2014 AND 2015.    WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE SECURITY DEPOSIT WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COVER FUTURE PAYMENT SHORTFALLS FROM OUR INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS.  FURTHER, ANY SECURITY DEPOSIT WE APPLY FOR SUCH SHORTFALLS DOES NOT RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CASH FLOW TO US AS WE ALREADY HOLD THOSE FUNDS.

AMENDMENT TO DECLARATION OF TRUST
 
ON APRIL 10, 2014, OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES (THE BOARD) (I) APPROVED AN AMENDMENT TO OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST TO PROVIDE FOR THE ANNUAL ELECTION OF TRUSTEES AND (II) DETERMINED TO PRESENT THIS AMENDMENT FOR APPROVAL BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS AT OUR 2014 ANNUAL MEETING. IF THIS AMENDMENT IS APPROVED BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS AT OUR 2014 ANNUAL MEETING, COMMENCING WITH THE CLASS OF TRUSTEES STANDING FOR ELECTION AT THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS, TRUSTEES WILL STAND FOR ELECTION FOR ONE-YEAR TERMS EXPIRING AT THE NEXT SUCCEEDING ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS. TRUSTEES WHOSE TERMS WILL EXPIRE IN 2016 AND 2017 WILL HOLD OFFICE UNTIL THE END OF THEIR CURRENT TERMS. ALL TRUSTEES WILL STAND FOR ELECTION AT THE 2017 ANNUAL MEETING, AND THEREAFTER, FOR ONE YEAR TERMS. IN ALL CASES, EACH TRUSTEE WILL HOLD OFFICE UNTIL HIS OR HER SUCCESSOR IS DULY ELECTED AND QUALIFIED OR UNTIL HIS OR HER EARLIER RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL.
 
AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS
 
ON APRIL 10, 2014, THE BOARD ALSO APPROVED AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS, EFFECTIVE THAT SAME DATE.  THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS REDUCED THE SHARE OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS FOR A SHAREHOLDER SEEKING TO NOMINATE AN INDIVIDUAL FOR ELECTION AS A TRUSTEE AT AN APPLICABLE MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS. PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS, THE PROPONENT SHAREHOLDER MUST OWN AT LEAST $2,000 IN MARKET VALUE, OR 1%, OF OUR SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST ENTITLED TO VOTE AT THE MEETING ON SUCH ELECTION CONTINUOUSLY FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR AT THE DATE THE SHAREHOLDER GIVES THE NOTICE OF PROPOSED NOMINATION OR PROPOSAL OF OTHER BUSINESS. FURTHER, THE SHAREHOLDER MUST PRESENT A SHARE CERTIFICATE FOR THOSE SHARES AND EVIDENCE OF CONTINUOUS OWNERSHIP OF THOSE SHARES FOR ONE YEAR AT THE TIME SUCH SHAREHOLDER GIVES THE REQUIRED NOTICE. THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS EXPAND THE SOURCES OF EVIDENCE THAT A SHAREHOLDER MAY PROVIDE TO EVIDENCE ITS CONTINUOUS OWNERSHIP OF SHARES SO THAT THE PROPONENT SHAREHOLDER MAY NOW PROVIDE COPIES OF CERTAIN FILINGS MADE PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE EXCHANGE ACT) OR A WRITTEN VERIFICATION OF SUCH CONTINUOUS OWNERSHIP FROM THE RECORD OWNER OF SUCH SHARES. UNDER THE COMPANYS BYLAWS AS THEY EXISTED IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THESE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS, ONE OR MORE SHAREHOLDERS SEEKING TO NOMINATE AN INDIVIDUAL FOR ELECTION AS A TRUSTEE AT AN APPLICABLE MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS MUST HAVE HELD, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, AT LEAST 3% OF THE COMPANYS SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST ENTITLED TO VOTE AT THE MEETING ON SUCH ELECTION, MUST HAVE HELD SUCH SHARES CONTINUOUSLY FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS AND MUST HAVE PRESENTED SHARE CERTIFICATE(S) FOR ALL SHARES OWNED BY SUCH SHAREHOLDERS WITH THE NOTICE.
 
THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS ALSO REVISE THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED BY A SHAREHOLDER WITH ITS NOTICE OF A NOMINATION OR PROPOSAL OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION (I) TO REDUCE THE TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS IN THE COMPANYS SECURITIES MUST BE PROVIDED FROM 36 MONTHS TO NOW 6 MONTHS, (II) TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO PROPOSED NOMINEES AND PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROPOSED NOMINEES, (III) TO LIMIT CERTAIN DISCLOSURES REGARDING PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH A SHAREHOLDER TO SUCH PERSONS WITH AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE COMPANY, WITH A MATERIAL INTEREST IN THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL OR WHO ARE A PARTY TO A DISCLOSED TRANSACTION OR AGREEMENT, AND (IV) TO REVISE THE INFORMATION THAT MUST BE PROVIDED WITH RESPECT TO PROPOSALS THAT WOULD CAUSE COVENANT BREACHES OR REQUIRE GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL.
 
THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS ALSO REVISE THE DEFAULT RECORD DATE FOR CERTAIN SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS AND REMOVED CERTAIN PROVISIONS THAT MERELY REPEATED A PROVISION IN THE COMPANYS DECLARATION OF TRUST. FURTHERMORE, THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS CLARIFY THAT THE DETERMINATION OF BENEFICIAL AND CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP FOR PURPOSES OF THE REIT OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS IN OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST INCLUDES SHARES THAT ARE DEEMED BENEFICIALLY OWNED UNDER RULE 13D-3 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS ALSO INCLUDE CERTAIN OTHER CONFORMING AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES.

BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AMENDMENTS
 
AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE RECENT CONSENT SOLICITATION TO REMOVE, WITHOUT CAUSE, ALL OF THE TRUSTEES OF COMMONWEALTH REIT, OR CWH, REIT MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH LLC, OR RMR, ANTICIPATES THAT ITS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CWH WILL BE TERMINATED AND THAT TERMINATION IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN CERTAIN WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS AND OTHER CHANGES AT RMR.  THE TIMING OF THE TERMINATION OF RMR'S MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CWH HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED.  NONETHELESS, IN ANTICIPATION OF SUCH A TERMINATION AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON RMR EMPLOYEES AND RMR'S PROVISION OF MANAGEMENT SERVICES, RMR, OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEES OF THE OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, OR REITS, TO WHICH RMR PROVIDES MANAGEMENT SERVICES CONSIDERED AMENDMENTS TO THE RMR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS TO FACILITATE EMPLOYEE RETENTION AND THE CONTINUED PROVISION OF MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO US AND TO THESE OTHER REITS, AND TO REQUIRE THAT RMR PROVIDE MANAGEMENT TRANSITION SERVICES IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES.  OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEES OF THESE OTHER REITS MANAGED BY RMR ENGAGED AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT TO ADVISE THEM ON THESE MATTERS AND NEGOTIATED THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS TO OUR BUSINESS AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH RMR.
 
ON MAY 9, 2014, WE AND RMR ENTERED INTO AMENDMENTS TO OUR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  THE CURRENT TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS END ON DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR SUCCESSIVE ONE YEAR TERMS UNLESS NOTICE OF NON-RENEWAL IS GIVEN BY US OR RMR BEFORE THE END OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENTS UPON 60 DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY A MAJORITY VOTE OF OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.  AS AMENDED, RMR MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENTS UPON 120 DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE.  PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENTS, RMR COULD TERMINATE THE AGREEMENTS UPON 60 DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE AND COULD ALSO TERMINATE THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT UPON FIVE BUSINESS DAYS NOTICE IF WE UNDERWENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL.
 
AS AMENDED, IF WE TERMINATE OR ELECT NOT TO RENEW THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, AS DEFINED, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY RMR A TERMINATION FEE EQUAL TO 2.75 TIMES THE SUM OF THE ANNUAL BASE MANAGEMENT FEE AND THE ANNUAL INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES EXPENSE, WHICH AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON AVERAGES DURING THE 24 CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE OF NOTICE OF NONRENEWAL OR TERMINATION.  IN ADDITION, AS AMENDED, IF WE TERMINATE OR ELECT NOT TO RENEW THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, AS DEFINED, WITHIN 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO OR FOLLOWING OUR GIVING NOTICE OF TERMINATION OR NON-RENEWAL OF THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY RMR A TERMINATION FEE EQUAL TO 12 TIMES THE AVERAGE MONTHLY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FEE FOR THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE NONRENEWAL OR TERMINATION.  THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN PROPORTIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TERMINATION FEES IF WE MERGE WITH ANOTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST TO WHICH RMR IS PROVIDING MANAGEMENT SERVICES OR IF WE SPIN-OFF A SUBSIDIARY OF OURS TO WHICH WE CONTRIBUTED PROPERTIES AND TO WHICH RMR IS PROVIDING MANAGEMENT SERVICES BOTH AT THE TIME OF THE SPIN-OFF AND ON THE DATE OF THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT.
 
AS AMENDED, RMR AGREES TO PROVIDE CERTAIN TRANSITION SERVICES TO US FOR 120 DAYS FOLLOWING AN APPLICABLE TERMINATION BY US OR NOTICE OF TERMINATION BY RMR, INCLUDING COOPERATING WITH US AND USING COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO FACILITATE THE ORDERLY TRANSFER OF THE MANAGEMENT AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND TO FACILITATE THE ORDERLY TRANSFER OF MANAGEMENT OF THE MANAGED PROPERTIES, AS APPLICABLE.

THE TERM LOAN BEARS INTEREST AT LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM OF 140 BASIS POINTS, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BASED ON CHANGES TO OUR UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT ARE UNSECURED. THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED TO GUARANTY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT ONLY IF SUCH SUBSIDIARY OR SUBSIDIARIES HAS OR HAVE SEPARATELY INCURRED DEBT (OTHER THAN NONRECOURSE DEBT), WITHIN THE MEANING SPECIFIED IN THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT, OR PROVIDED A GUARANTEE OF DEBT INCURRED BY US OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES.

ON MARCH 31, 2014, WE ACQUIRED A GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL AND AN ADJACENT PARCEL FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $115 MILLION. THE
FACILITY WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY LEASED BACK TO ITS CURRENT OPERATOR UNDER A LEASE WITH A 15-YEAR INITIAL TERM WITH A 3-YEAR EXTENSION OPTION, FOLLOWED BY A FURTHER 12-YEAR EXTENSION OPTION AT FAIR MARKET VALUE. THE LEASE PROVIDES FOR CONSUMER

THIS POTENTIAL HOSPITAL ACQUISITION IS CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE NEGOTIATION AND EXECUTION OF DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND THE COMPLETION OF SATISFACTORY DUE DILIGENCE. IF CONSUMMATED, WE EXPECT TO FUND THE PURCHASE PRICE WITH CASH ON
HAND, INCLUDING ANY REMAINING NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING, AND, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT, WE REFER TO THIS POTENTIAL HOSPITAL ACQUISITION AS THE

EXTENSION OPTIONS AND CONSUMER PRICE-INDEXED ANNUAL RENT INCREASES, SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED FLOOR. WHILE WE EXPECT DEFINITIVE DOCUMENTATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE EXECUTED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2014, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT
DEFINITIVE DOCUMENTATION WILL BE EXECUTED ON THE TERMS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR AT ALL.  POTENTIAL DISPOSITION 
AS DESCRIBED IN OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT, AS OF
DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE HAD $21.0 MILLION OF RENT, INTEREST AND OTHER CHARGES OWED TO US BY THE OPERATOR/LESSEE OF MONROE HOSPITAL IN BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ADVANCED $31.1 MILLION TO THE OPERATOR/LESSEE PURSUANT TO A WORKING
CAPITAL LOAN AGREEMENT. BECAUSE THE OPERATOR HAS NOT MADE ALL PAYMENTS REQUIRED BY THE REAL ESTATE LEASE AGREEMENT AND WORKING CAPITAL LOAN AGREEMENT, WE CONSIDER THE LOAN TO BE IMPAIRED. 
DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 WE COMMENCED AND ARE NOW IN ADVANCED DISCUSSIONS WITH A THIRD PARTY WITH RESPECT TO A RESTRUCTURING OF OUR
INVESTMENT IN THE FORM OF A NEW JOINT VENTURE THAT WOULD ACQUIRE THE REAL ESTATE OF MONROE HOSPITAL AND RELATED ASSETS IN EXCHANGE FOR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND PROMISSORY NOTES. WE WILL ALSO BE ENTITLED TO SHARE IN THE JOINT VENTURES PROFITS
DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF OPERATIONS. WHILE WE EXPECT THE TRANSACTION TO CLOSE 


DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2014, THE TRANSACTION IS CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
NEGOTIATION AND EXECUTION OF DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND THE COMPLETION OF SATISFACTORY DUE DILIGENCE, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL BE CONSUMMATED ON THE TERMS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR AT ALL. 
IF CONSUMMATED, WE BELIEVE THIS TRANSACTION WILL RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF UP TO $20 MILLION TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014. IF
THE TRANSACTION IS NOT COMPLETED AS CURRENTLY EXPECTED, FURTHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES COULD BE INCURRED.  THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN

AMENDMENT TO DECLARATION OF TRUST
 
ON APRIL 9, 2014, OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES (THE BOARD) (I) APPROVED AN AMENDMENT TO OUR DECLARATION OF TRUST TO PROVIDE FOR THE ANNUAL ELECTION OF TRUSTEES AND (II) DETERMINED TO PRESENT THIS AMENDMENT FOR APPROVAL BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS AT OUR 2014 ANNUAL MEETING. IF THIS AMENDMENT IS APPROVED BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS AT OUR 2014 ANNUAL MEETING, COMMENCING WITH THE CLASS OF TRUSTEES STANDING FOR ELECTION AT THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS, TRUSTEES WILL STAND FOR ELECTION FOR ONE-YEAR TERMS EXPIRING AT THE NEXT SUCCEEDING ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS. TRUSTEES WHOSE TERMS WILL EXPIRE IN 2016 AND 2017 WILL HOLD OFFICE UNTIL THE END OF THEIR CURRENT TERMS. ALL TRUSTEES WILL STAND FOR ELECTION AT THE 2017 ANNUAL MEETING, AND THEREAFTER, FOR ONE YEAR TERMS. IN ALL CASES, EACH TRUSTEE WILL HOLD OFFICE UNTIL HIS OR HER SUCCESSOR IS DULY ELECTED AND QUALIFIED OR UNTIL HIS OR HER EARLIER RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL.
 
AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS
 
ON APRIL 9, 2014, THE BOARD ALSO APPROVED AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS, EFFECTIVE THAT SAME DATE.  THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS REMOVED THE GENERAL REQUIREMENT THAT THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF 75% OF THE VOTES ENTITLED TO BE CAST WAS REQUIRED FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO APPROVE CERTAIN MATTERS NOT PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARD AND THAT THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF VOTES CAST WAS REQUIRED FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO APPROVE THOSE MATTERS IF THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARD.  AS A RESULT OF THE REMOVAL OF THAT REQUIREMENT, APPROVAL OF MATTERS VOTED ON BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS, OTHER THAN THE ELECTION OF TRUSTEES OR AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LISTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRINCIPAL EXCHANGE ON WHICH THE COMPANYS COMMON SHARES ARE LISTED OR BY A SPECIFIC PROVISION OF THE DECLARATION OF TRUST, REQUIRES THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF VOTES CAST.
 
THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS ALSO REDUCED THE SHARE OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS FOR A SHAREHOLDER SEEKING TO NOMINATE AN INDIVIDUAL FOR ELECTION AS A TRUSTEE AT AN APPLICABLE MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS. PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS, THE PROPONENT SHAREHOLDER MUST OWN AT LEAST $2,000 IN MARKET VALUE, OR 1%, OF OUR SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST ENTITLED TO VOTE AT THE MEETING ON SUCH ELECTION CONTINUOUSLY FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR AT THE DATE THE SHAREHOLDER GIVES THE NOTICE OF PROPOSED NOMINATION OR PROPOSAL OF OTHER BUSINESS. FURTHER, THE SHAREHOLDER MUST PRESENT A SHARE CERTIFICATE FOR THOSE SHARES AND EVIDENCE OF CONTINUOUS OWNERSHIP OF THOSE SHARES FOR ONE YEAR AT THE TIME SUCH SHAREHOLDER GIVES THE REQUIRED NOTICE. THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS EXPAND THE SOURCES OF EVIDENCE THAT A SHAREHOLDER MAY PROVIDE TO EVIDENCE ITS CONTINUOUS OWNERSHIP OF SHARES SO THAT THE PROPONENT SHAREHOLDER MAY NOW PROVIDE COPIES OF CERTAIN FILINGS MADE PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 OR A WRITTEN VERIFICATION OF SUCH CONTINUOUS OWNERSHIP FROM THE RECORD OWNER OF SUCH SHARES. UNDER THE COMPANYS BYLAWS AS THEY EXISTED IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THESE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS, ONE OR MORE SHAREHOLDERS SEEKING TO NOMINATE AN INDIVIDUAL FOR ELECTION AS A TRUSTEE AT AN APPLICABLE MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS MUST HAVE HELD, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, AT LEAST 3% OF THE COMPANYS SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST ENTITLED TO VOTE AT THE MEETING ON SUCH ELECTION, MUST HAVE HELD SUCH SHARES CONTINUOUSLY FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS AND MUST HAVE PRESENTED SHARE CERTIFICATE(S) FOR ALL SHARES OWNED BY SUCH SHAREHOLDERS WITH THE NOTICE.
 
THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS ALSO REVISE THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED BY A SHAREHOLDER WITH ITS NOTICE OF A NOMINATION OR PROPOSAL OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION (I) TO REDUCE THE TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS IN THE COMPANYS SECURITIES MUST BE PROVIDED FROM 36 MONTHS TO NOW 6 MONTHS, (II) TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO PROPOSED NOMINEES AND PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROPOSED NOMINEES, (III) TO LIMIT CERTAIN DISCLOSURES REGARDING PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH A SHAREHOLDER TO SUCH PERSONS WITH AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE COMPANY, WITH A MATERIAL INTEREST IN THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL OR WHO ARE A PARTY TO A DISCLOSED TRANSACTION OR AGREEMENT, AND (IV) TO REVISE THE INFORMATION THAT MUST BE PROVIDED WITH RESPECT TO PROPOSALS THAT WOULD CAUSE COVENANT BREACHES OR REQUIRE GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL.
 
THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS ALSO REVISE THE DEFAULT RECORD DATE FOR CERTAIN SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS AND REMOVED CERTAIN PROVISIONS THAT MERELY REPEATED A PROVISION IN THE COMPANYS DECLARATION OF TRUST. THE AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS ALSO INCLUDE CERTAIN OTHER CONFORMING AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES.

NONETHELESS, IN ANTICIPATION OF SUCH A TERMINATION AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON RMR EMPLOYEES AND RMRS PROVISION OF MANAGEMENT SERVICES, RMR, OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEES OF THE OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, OR REITS, TO WHICH RMR PROVIDES MANAGEMENT SERVICES CONSIDERED AMENDMENTS TO THE RMR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS TO FACILITATE EMPLOYEE RETENTION AND THE CONTINUED PROVISION OF MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO US AND TO THESE OTHER REITS, AND TO REQUIRE THAT RMR PROVIDE MANAGEMENT TRANSITION SERVICES IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEES OF THESE OTHER REITS MANAGED BY RMR ENGAGED AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT TO ADVISE THEM ON THESE MATTERS AND NEGOTIATED THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS TO OUR BUSINESS AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH RMR.
 
ON MAY 9, 2014, WE AND RMR ENTERED INTO AMENDMENTS TO OUR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  THE CURRENT TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS END ON DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR SUCCESSIVE ONE YEAR TERMS UNLESS NOTICE OF NON-RENEWAL IS GIVEN BY US OR RMR BEFORE THE END OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENTS UPON 60 DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY A MAJORITY VOTE OF OUR INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES.  AS AMENDED, RMR MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENTS UPON 120 DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE.  PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENTS, RMR COULD TERMINATE THE AGREEMENTS UPON 60 DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE AND COULD ALSO TERMINATE THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT UPON FIVE BUSINESS DAYS NOTICE IF WE UNDERWENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL.
 
AS AMENDED, IF WE TERMINATE OR ELECT NOT TO RENEW THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, AS DEFINED, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY RMR A TERMINATION FEE EQUAL TO 2.75 TIMES THE SUM OF THE ANNUAL BASE MANAGEMENT FEE AND THE ANNUAL INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES EXPENSE, WHICH AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON AVERAGES DURING THE 24 CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE OF NOTICE OF NONRENEWAL OR TERMINATION.  IN ADDITION, AS AMENDED, IF WE TERMINATE OR ELECT NOT TO RENEW THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, AS DEFINED, WITHIN 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO OR FOLLOWING OUR GIVING NOTICE OF TERMINATION OR NON-RENEWAL OF THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY RMR A TERMINATION FEE EQUAL TO 12 TIMES THE AVERAGE MONTHLY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FEE FOR THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE NONRENEWAL OR TERMINATION.  THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN PROPORTIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TERMINATION FEES IF WE MERGE WITH ANOTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST TO WHICH RMR IS PROVIDING MANAGEMENT SERVICES OR IF WE SPIN-OFF A SUBSIDIARY OF OURS TO WHICH WE CONTRIBUTED PROPERTIES AND TO WHICH RMR IS PROVIDING MANAGEMENT SERVICES BOTH AT THE TIME OF THE SPIN-OFF AND ON THE DATE OF THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT.
 
AS AMENDED, RMR AGREES TO PROVIDE CERTAIN TRANSITION SERVICES TO US FOR 120 DAYS FOLLOWING AN APPLICABLE TERMINATION BY US OR NOTICE OF TERMINATION BY RMR, INCLUDING COOPERATING WITH US AND USING COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO FACILITATE THE ORDERLY TRANSFER OF THE MANAGEMENT AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND TO FACILITATE THE ORDERLY TRANSFER OF MANAGEMENT OF THE MANAGED PROPERTIES, AS APPLICABLE.

CURRENTLY EXPECT TO ASSUME APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION OF MORTGAGE DEBT ON TWO OF THE HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES AND TO FUND THE BALANCE OF THE PURCHASE PRICE USING CASH ON HAND AND
DRAWINGS UNDER OUR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY. ON A LONGER TERM BASIS, WE EXPECT TO FINANCE THIS ACQUISITION WITH AN APPROPRIATE MIX OF DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL, DEPENDING ON THE COST OF SUCH FINANCINGS

  WARNING CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS     
THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K CONTAINS STATEMENTS WHICH CONSTITUTE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS. ALSO, WHENEVER WE USE WORDS SUCH AS ""BELIEVE"", ""EXPECT"", ""ANTICIPATE"", ""INTEND"", ""PLAN"", ESTIMATE"", OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, WE ARE MAKING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON OUR PRESENT INTENT, BELIEFS OR EXPECTATIONS, BUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER
MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. FOR EXAMPLE:


THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K STATES THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO ACQUIRE THE HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES.
THE CLOSING OF THIS TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO

3



 




CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. THE MERGER IS ITSELF SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING APPROVALS BY THE SHAREHOLDERS OF SIR
AND STOCKHOLDERS OF CCIT. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES TO THE MERGER OR THE OTHER CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES TO OUR ACQUISITION OF THE HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES WILL
BE SATISFIED. ACCORDINGLY, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ACQUISITION OF THE HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES WILL BE CONSUMMATED, THAT IT WILL NOT BE DELAYED OR THAT ITS TERMS WILL NOT
CHANGE.


THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K STATES THAT WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO ASSUME APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION
OF MORTGAGE DEBT ON TWO OF THE MOBS INCLUDED IN THE HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES AND TO FUND THE BALANCE OF THE PURCHASE PRICE USING CASH ON HAND AND DRAWINGS UNDER OUR UNSECURED REVOLVING BANK CREDIT
FACILITY. OUR ASSUMPTION OF THE $30 MILLION OF MORTGAGES WILL REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF THE MORTGAGEES WHICH MAY NOT BE OBTAINED. ALSO, ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY HAVE CASH ON HAND AND THE FULL $750 MILLION
AVAILABLE FOR DRAWINGS UNDER OUR UNSECURED REVOLVING BANK CREDIT FACILITY, THE AMOUNTS OF CASH AND AVAILABLE DRAWINGS MAY BE LESS THAN REQUIRED TO CLOSE WHEN OUR PURCHASE OF THE HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES
OCCURS. FOR THESE REASONS OR IN OUR DISCRETION, WE MAY FUND THIS ACQUISITION THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS.
THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K STATES THAT WE EXPECT TO LONG TERM FINANCE THE ACQUISITION WITH AN
APPROPRIATE MIX OF DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL. OUR ACTUAL MIX OF DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF SUCH FINANCING, AND THE FINAL MIX OF FINANCING MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM
CURRENT EXPECTATIONS.

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SEC, INCLUDING UNDER ""RISK FACTORS"" IN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS, OR INCORPORATED THEREIN, IDENTIFIES OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT

ON DECEMBER 22, 2014, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT, OR THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, TO ACQUIRE 38 SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES FROM CNL LIFESTYLE PROPERTIES, INC. AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR CNL LIFESTYLE PROPERTIES, FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $790 MILLION, INCLUDING ASSUMED DEBT BUT EXCLUDING CLOSING COSTS.  THESE FACILITIES INCLUDE AN AGGREGATE OF 3,466 LIVING UNITS, COMPRISED OF 826 INDEPENDENT LIVING UNITS, 1,860 ASSISTED LIVING UNITS, 744 MEMORY CARE UNITS AND 36 SKILLED NURSING FACILITY UNITS.  OF THE 38 FACILITIES, 18 ARE LEASED TO SIX UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO TRIPLE NET LEASES AND 20 ARE MANAGED BY SIX UNRELATED THIRD PARTY MANAGERS FOR THE ACCOUNT OF CNL LIFESTYLE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING ONE MANAGER WHO ALSO LEASES ONE OF THE 18 LEASED FACILITIES.  WE INTEND TO MEET WITH THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMMUNITIES IN THE COMING WEEKS TO DISCUSS PLANS FOR OUR OWNERSHIP OF THESE COMMUNITIES.  THESE 20 COMMUNITIES ARE SUBJECT TO AGREEMENTS THAT ARE TERMINABLE UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS.
 
THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT CONTAINS CERTAIN CLOSING CONDITIONS, AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL THOSE CONDITIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WILL BE SATISFIED.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO COMPLETE OUR ACQUISITION OF THESE FACILITIES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2015.  HOWEVER, THE CLOSING COULD BE DELAYED OR MAY NOT OCCUR AT ALL, AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION WILL NOT CHANGE.
 
WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO ASSUME AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY $153 MILLION OF DEBT SECURED BY MORTGAGES ON CERTAIN OF THE SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES WE HAVE AGREED TO ACQUIRE AT AN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 4.8% PER ANNUM.  SIMULTANEOUS WITH ENTERING THE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE THESE PROPERTIES, WE RECEIVED A BRIDGE LOAN COMMITMENT FOR UP TO $700 MILLION FROM WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A. AND CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC.  IN ADDITION TO THE BRIDGE LOAN, WE MAINTAIN A $750 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT IS CURRENTLY SUBSTANTIALLY UNDRAWN.  ON A LONGER TERM BASIS, WE EXPECT TO FINANCE THIS ACQUISITION WITH AN APPROPRIATE MIX OF EQUITY AND DEBT CAPITAL, DEPENDING ON THE COST OF SUCH FINANCINGS AND FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS.
 
THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTION OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS NOT COMPLETE AND IS SUBJECT TO AND QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS FILED AS EXHIBIT 2.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  CERTAIN OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT WERE MADE AS OF A SPECIFIED DATE, MAY BE SUBJECT TO A CONTRACTUAL STANDARD OF MATERIALITY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MIGHT BE VIEWED AS MATERIAL TO SHAREHOLDERS, OR MAY HAVE BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ALLOCATING RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  ACCORDINGLY, THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT ARE NOT NECESSARILY CHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE ACTUAL STATE OF FACTS ABOUT US, CNL LIFESTYLE PROPERTIES OR THE SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES AT THE TIME THEY WERE MADE OR OTHERWISE.

THIS ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CLOSING CONDITIONS.  THESE CONDITIONS MAY NOT BE SATISFIED AND THE ACQUISITION MAY NOT OCCUR, MAY BE DELAYED OR THE TERMS MAY CHANGE.
 
·               THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES THAT WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO ASSUME APPROXIMATELY $153 MILLION OF MORTGAGE DEBT ON CERTAIN OF THE SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES TO BE ACQUIRED. OUR ASSUMPTION OF THE $153 MILLION OF MORTGAGES WILL REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF THE MORTGAGEES WHICH MAY NOT BE OBTAINED.

IF THE BRIDGE LOAN AND/OR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO US FOR ANY REASON, WE MAY BE FORCED TO OBTAIN ALTERNATE FINANCING WHICH MAY BE ON TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE TO US THAN THOSE UNDER THE BRIDGE LOAN AND/OR THE UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY.
 
·               THIS CURRENT REPORT STATES THAT WE EXPECT TO LONG TERM FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF THE 38 SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES WITH AN APPROPRIATE MIX OF EQUITY AND DEBT CAPITAL.

THE MODIFIED GUIDANCE DISCLOSED IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 IS BASED UPON A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SUFFICIENTLY SPECIFIC AND ARE REASONABLE, THEY ARE NEVERTHELESS SUBJECT TO BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE UNCERTAINTIES.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY’S ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES.  IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SET FORTH IN OUR PERIODIC FILINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE MEASURES ARE HELPFUL TO INVESTORS IN MEASURING ITS PERFORMANCE AND COMPARING SUCH PERFORMANCE TO OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (“REITS”).  SINCE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS INCLUDABLE IN NET INCOME, RELIANCE ON THE MEASURES HAS LIMITATIONS; MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY USING THE MEASURES SIMPLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ARE WEIGHED IN BALANCE WITH OTHER GAAP AND NON-GAAP MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIONS OF THE COMPANY’S CASH FLOW AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH NEEDS.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR PAY DEBT SERVICE.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (“FFO” OR “FFO PER NAREIT”) DEFINED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) COMPUTED USING GAAP, EXCLUDING GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  WHEN MULTIPLE PROPERTIES CONSISTING OF BOTH OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING PROPERTIES EXIST ON A SINGLE TAX PARCEL, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ALL OF THE GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, THE TAX PARCEL AS ALL BEING FOR PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES WHEN MOST OF THE VALUE OF THE PARCEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING PROPERTIES ON THE PARCEL.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT USES THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST’S (“NAREIT”) DEFINITION OF FFO, ALTHOUGH OTHERS MAY INTERPRET THE DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY’S PRESENTATION OF FFO MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO IS USEFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE, BY EXCLUDING GAINS RELATED TO SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, FFO CAN HELP ONE COMPARE ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFO.BASIC FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“BASIC FFO”) THIS MEASURE IS FFO ADJUSTED TO SUBTRACT (1) PREFERRED SHARE DIVIDENDS, (2) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF PREFERRED UNITS IN CORPORATE OFFICE PROPERTIES, L.P. (THE “OPERATING PARTNERSHIP”) OR INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES NOT OWNED BY THE COMPANY, (3) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ALLOCABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES, (4) BASIC FFO ALLOCABLE TO RESTRICTED SHARES AND (5) ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS, BASIC FFO REPRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND HOLDERS OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP (“COMMON UNITS”).  COMMON UNITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE COMPANY’S COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST (“COMMON SHARES”) AND ARE EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASIC FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS DUE TO THE CLOSE CORRELATION OF COMMON UNITS TO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO BASIC FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“DILUTED FFO”) DILUTED FFO IS BASIC FFO ADJUSTED TO ADD BACK ANY CHANGES IN BASIC FFO THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE ASSUMED CONVERSION OF SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS AND, AS A RESULT, BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

HOWEVER, IT HAS MODIFIED ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED GUIDANCE FOR FFOPS AND DILUTED EPS TO REFLECT ITS EXPECTATION THAT THE TRANSFER OF TWO OPERATING PROPERTIES IN SATISFACTION OF NON-RECOURSE SECURED INDEBTEDNESS, PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED TO OCCUR BY DECEMBER 31, 2014, WILL LIKELY OCCUR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015.  THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED GUIDANCE FOR:•FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY, OF BETWEEN $0.48 AND $0.50 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND BETWEEN $1.87 AND $1.89 FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014;•FFOPS OF BETWEEN $1.09 AND $1.11 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND BETWEEN $2.43 AND $2.45 FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014; AND•DILUTED EPS OF BETWEEN $0.74 AND $0.76 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND BETWEEN $0.98 AND $1.00 FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014.THE COMPANY HAS MODIFIED ITS GUIDANCE AS FOLLOWS:•THE COMPANY IS AFFIRMING ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED GUIDANCE FOR FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY;•FFOPS OF BETWEEN $0.33 AND $0.35 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND BETWEEN $1.65 AND $1.67 FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014; AND•DILUTED EPS OF BETWEEN ($0.02) AND $0.00 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND BETWEEN $0.20 AND $0.22 FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014.RISK FACTOR - RESULTS REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS GUIDANCE MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED. THE MODIFIED GUIDANCE DISCLOSED IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 IS BASED UPON A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.  WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SUFFICIENTLY SPECIFIC AND ARE REASONABLE, THEY ARE NEVERTHELESS SUBJECT TO BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE UNCERTAINTIES.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY’S ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES.  IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SET FORTH IN OUR PERIODIC FILINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.  A RECONCILIATION OF PROJECTED DILUTED EPS TO PROJECTED FFOPS FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 IS PROVIDED, AS FOLLOWS: THREE MONTHS ENDING YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 DECEMBER 31, 2014 LOW HIGH LOW HIGHEPS$(0.02) $— $0.20 $0.22REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION0.35 0.35 1.49 1.49GAINS ON SALES OF PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED PROPERTIES— — (0.06) (0.06)IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED PROPERTIES— — 0.02 0.02FFOPS, NAREIT DEFINITION0.33 0.35 1.65 1.67NOI FROM PROPERTIES TO BE CONVEYED (A)(0.01) (0.01) (0.02) (0.02)INTEREST EXPENSE ON LOAN SECURED BY PROPERTIES TO BE CONVEYED (A)0.05 0.05 0.15 0.15GAINS ON SALES OF UNDEPRECIATED PROPERTIES— — (0.05) (0.05)EXECUTIVE TRANSITION COSTS0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01LOSSES, NET, ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT0.10 0.10 0.11 0.11ISSUANCE COST OF REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES— — 0.02 0.02FFOPS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY$0.48 $0.50 $1.87 $1.89        A.THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO TRANSFER TWO OPERATING PROPERTIES IN SATISFACTION OF NON-RECOURSE SECURED INDEBTEDNESS IN 2015 THAT WE EXPECT WILL RESULT IN A GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT.  THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE COMPANY’S FORECAST OF NET OPERATING INCOME GENERATED BY THESE ASSETS AND INTEREST EXPENSE (ACCRUED AT THE DEFAULT RATE) FROM APRIL 1ST THROUGH YEAR-END.THE COMPANY USES THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DESCRIBED BELOW IN EARNINGS PRESS RELEASES AND INFORMATION FURNISHED TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE MEASURES ARE HELPFUL TO INVESTORS IN MEASURING ITS PERFORMANCE AND COMPARING SUCH PERFORMANCE TO OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (“REITS”).  SINCE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS INCLUDABLE IN NET INCOME, RELIANCE ON THE MEASURES HAS LIMITATIONS; MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY USING THE MEASURES SIMPLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ARE WEIGHED IN BALANCE WITH OTHER GAAP AND NON-GAAP MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIONS OF THE COMPANY’S CASH FLOW AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH NEEDS.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR PAY DEBT SERVICE.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (“FFO” OR “FFO PER NAREIT”) DEFINED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) COMPUTED USING GAAP, EXCLUDING GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  WHEN MULTIPLE PROPERTIES CONSISTING OF BOTH OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING PROPERTIES EXIST ON A SINGLE TAX PARCEL, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ALL OF THE GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, THE TAX PARCEL AS ALL BEING FOR PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES WHEN MOST OF THE VALUE OF THE PARCEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING PROPERTIES ON THE PARCEL.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT USES THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST’S (“NAREIT”) DEFINITION OF FFO, ALTHOUGH OTHERS MAY INTERPRET THE DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY’S PRESENTATION OF FFO MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO IS USEFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE, BY EXCLUDING GAINS RELATED TO SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE-RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, FFO CAN HELP ONE COMPARE ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFO.BASIC FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“BASIC FFO”) THIS MEASURE IS FFO ADJUSTED TO SUBTRACT (1) PREFERRED SHARE DIVIDENDS, (2) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF PREFERRED UNITS IN CORPORATE OFFICE PROPERTIES, L.P. (THE “OPERATING PARTNERSHIP”) OR INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES NOT OWNED BY THE COMPANY, (3) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ALLOCABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES, (4) BASIC FFO ALLOCABLE TO RESTRICTED SHARES AND (5) ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS, BASIC FFO REPRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND HOLDERS OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP (“COMMON UNITS”).  COMMON UNITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE COMPANY’S COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST (“COMMON SHARES”) AND ARE EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASIC FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS DUE TO THE CLOSE CORRELATION OF COMMON UNITS TO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET (LOSS) INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO BASIC FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS (“DILUTED FFO”) DILUTED FFO IS BASIC FFO ADJUSTED TO ADD BACK ANY CHANGES IN BASIC FFO THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE ASSUMED CONVERSION OF SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES.  THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED FFO ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DILUTED FFO IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT IS THE NUMERATOR USED TO COMPUTE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE, DISCUSSED BELOW.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO DILUTED FFO.DILUTED FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND COMMON UNIT HOLDERS, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY (“DILUTED FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY”) AND FFO, AS ADJUSTED FOR COMPARABILITY DEFINED AS DILUTED FFO OR FFO ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE: OPERATING PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS: GAINS ON SALES OF, AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON, PROPERTIES OTHER THAN PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES, NET OF ASSOCIATED INCOME TAX; GAIN OR LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; FFO ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTIES SECURING NON-RECOURSE DEBT ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DEFAULTED AND WHICH THE COMPANY HAS EXTINGUISHED, OR EXPECTS TO EXTINGUISH, VIA CONVEYANCE OF THOSE PROPERTIES (INCLUDING PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND GAINS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT); LOSS ON INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES; EXECUTIVE TRANSITION COSTS; AND ACCOUNTING CHARGES FOR ORIGINAL ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEEMED PREFERRED SHARES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF NORMAL OPERATIONS AND, AS A RESULT, BELIEVES THAT A MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES THESE ITEMS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN EVALUATING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMERATOR TO DILUTED EPS IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE.DILUTED FFO PER SHARE (“FFOPS”)FFOPS IS (1) DILUTED FFO DIVIDED BY (2) THE SUM OF THE (A) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD, (B) WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON UNITS OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD AND (C) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING DURING A PERIOD IF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON SHARES WERE CONVERTED OR EXCHANGED.  THE COMPUTATION OF FFOPS ASSUMES THE CONVERSION OF COMMON UNITS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE CONVERSION OF OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES IF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD INCREASE DILUTED FFO PER SHARE IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFOPS IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH A FURTHER CONTEXT FOR EVALUATING OUR FFO RESULTS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT INVESTORS USE EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) IN EVALUATING NET (LOSS) INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS.
