OTHER EVENTS.






ON FEBRUARY 23, 2015, WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. (THE “COMPANY”) ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMPANY’S OUTLOOK HAS CHANGED SINCE IT WAS DISCUSSED IN DECEMBER’S FISCAL YEAR 2015 SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS CALL.  THE PRICE OF STEEL HAS DROPPED OVER $100 A TON SINCE MID-DECEMBER. THE AMOUNT AND SPEED OF THE DECLINE WAS NOT ANTICIPATED.  WHEN STEEL PRICES FALL, THE COMPANY TYPICALLY HAS HIGHER-PRICED BASE INVENTORY FLOWING THROUGH COST OF GOODS SOLD, WHILE SELLING PRICES COMPRESS TO MARKET LEVELS, REDUCING MARGINS AND EARNINGS.  THE PRICE DECLINE, COMBINED WITH SOFTENING DEMAND IN A FEW KEY END-MARKETS, INCLUDING OIL AND GAS AND AGRICULTURE, WILL CAUSE EARNINGS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW LAST YEAR’S THIRD QUARTER AND ARE EXPECTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECT FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS.  ADDITIONALLY, CONTINUED HIGHER THAN NORMAL OPERATING COSTS IN CERTAIN PRESSURE CYLINDERS AND ENGINEERED CABS OPERATIONS, AS DISCUSSED DURING LAST QUARTER’S CALL, WILL ALSO BE FACTORS.



THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ACTIVELY REPURCHASING ITS COMMON SHARES PURSUANT TO PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED AUTHORIZATIONS APPROVED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE COMPANY HAS IN PLACE A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN, ADMINISTERED BY AN INDEPENDENT BROKER, PURSUANT TO WHICH REPURCHASES OF COMMON SHARES AGGREGATING UP TO $60 MILLION MAY BE MADE THROUGH APRIL 9, 2015, UNLESS THE PLAN IS EARLIER TERMINATED PURSUANT TO ITS TERMS.  THE PLAN WAS ESTABLISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND AS PART OF, THE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATIONS UNDER WHICH 8.8 MILLION COMMON SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE.

ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.



 
ON MARCH 27, 2015, OLIN CORPORATION (“OLIN”) AND THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY (“TDCC”) ANNOUNCED THAT THEY AND CERTAIN AFFILIATES HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE “MERGER AGREEMENT”) DATED MARCH 26, 2015 AMONG OLIN, TDCC, BLUE CUBE ACQUISITION CORP. (“MERGER SUB”) AND BLUE CUBE SPINCO INC. (“SPINCO”), PURSUANT TO WHICH, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND A SEPARATION AGREEMENT DATED MARCH 26, 2015 BETWEEN TDCC AND SPINCO (THE “SEPARATION AGREEMENT”),  (1) TDCC WILL TRANSFER ITS U.S. CHLOR-ALKALI AND VINYL, GLOBAL CHLORINATED ORGANICS AND GLOBAL EPOXY BUSINESSES (COLLECTIVELY, THE “BUSINESS”) TO SPINCO, (2) TDCC WILL DISTRIBUTE SPINCO’S STOCK TO TDCC’S SHAREHOLDERS, AT TDCC’S OPTION, BY WAY OF A SPIN-OFF, A SPLIT-OFF OR A COMBINATION THEREOF (THE “DISTRIBUTION”), AND (3) MERGER SUB WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO SPINCO, WITH SPINCO AS THE SURVIVING CORPORATION (THE “MERGER”).


UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT, THE SHARES OF SPINCO COMMON STOCK THEN OUTSTANDING WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE CONVERTED INTO APPROXIMATELY 80.6 MILLION SHARES OF OLIN COMMON STOCK AND WILL REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 50.5% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OLIN COMMON STOCK.  OLIN’S EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THE REMAINING APPROXIMATELY 49.5% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OLIN COMMON STOCK.  IN THE EVENT THAT CERTAIN SPECIFIED JOINT VENTURE INTERESTS OWNED BY AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY PARTICIPANT IN A TDCC CHLOR-ALKALI JOINT VENTURE ARE TRANSFERRED TO SPINCO IN THE TRANSACTION, APPROXIMATELY 6.9 MILLION SHARES OF ADDITIONAL OLIN COMMON STOCK WOULD BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER TO THE TDCC SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVING THE DISTRIBUTION.


IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT, CERTAIN ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE ENTERED INTO, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS:






  


●

●


A TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT, WHICH WILL GOVERN TDCC’S, SPINCO’S AND OLIN’S RESPECTIVE RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO TAXES, TAX ATTRIBUTES, THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF TAX RETURNS, TAX CONTESTS, PRESERVATION OF TAX-FREE STATUS OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX MATTERS; AND









  


●


SITE, TRANSITIONAL AND OTHER SERVICES AGREEMENTS, SUPPLY AND PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, REAL ESTATE AGREEMENTS, TECHNOLOGY LICENSES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGREEMENTS.





IN ADDITION, OLIN AND TDCC HAVE AGREED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS TO ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE LONG-TERM SUPPLY OF ETHYLENE BY TDCC TO OLIN AT “CO-PRODUCER” ECONOMICS, PURSUANT TO WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OLIN WILL MAKE AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF JUST OVER $300 MILLION UPON THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. OLIN WILL ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FUTURE ETHYLENE SUPPLY BY PAYING AN ADDITIONAL RESERVATION FEE AT CLOSING.
 
 


  


  





  

 
 

SEPARATION AGREEMENT


THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT IDENTIFIES ASSETS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO, AND LIABILITIES TO BE ASSUMED BY, SPINCO AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AS PART OF THE SEPARATION OF THE BUSINESS FROM THE OTHER BUSINESSES OF TDCC (THE “SEPARATION”). IN PARTICULAR, THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT PROVIDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED THEREIN:






  


●


ASSETS RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE BUSINESS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, WILL BE TRANSFERRED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO SPINCO (THE “SPINCO ASSETS”);









  


●


CERTAIN LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO THE SPINCO ASSETS OR THE BUSINESS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, WILL BE ASSUMED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY SPINCO (THE “SPINCO LIABILITIES”); AND









  


●


ALL OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF TDCC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OTHER THAN THE SPINCO ASSETS AND SPINCO LIABILITIES, WILL BE RETAINED BY OR TRANSFERRED TO TDCC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.





THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT GOVERNS THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF TDCC AND SPINCO REGARDING THE DISTRIBUTION. THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT ALSO SETS FORTH OTHER AGREEMENTS BETWEEN TDCC AND SPINCO RELATED TO THE SEPARATION, INCLUDING PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE TERMINATION AND SETTLEMENT OF INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS, OBTAINING GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS AND THIRD PARTY CONSENTS AND WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS. THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT ALSO SETS FORTH AGREEMENTS THAT GOVERN CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TDCC AND SPINCO AFTER THE DISTRIBUTION, INCLUDING PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RELEASE OF CLAIMS, INDEMNIFICATION, INSURANCE, ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO AND PROVISION OF RECORDS.


PRIOR TO THE DISTRIBUTION, TDCC WILL RECEIVE FROM SPINCO DISTRIBUTIONS OF CASH AND DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF SPINCO WITH AN AGGREGATE VALUE OF $2,030 MILLION (COLLECTIVELY, THE “CASH AND DEBT DISTRIBUTION”). TDCC EXPECTS TO DELIVER THE SPINCO DEBT INSTRUMENTS RECEIVED IN THE CASH AND DEBT DISTRIBUTION IN EXCHANGE FOR OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO BE IDENTIFIED BY TDCC PRIOR TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION (THE “EXCHANGE”).  AS THE CASH PORTION OF THE CASH AND DEBT DISTRIBUTION, TDCC WILL RECEIVE FROM SPINCO A TOTAL OF $875 MILLION IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE DISTRIBUTION.  THE AMOUNT OF THE CASH AND DEBT DISTRIBUTION IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT, INCLUDING ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON SPINCO’S WORKING CAPITAL AT THE TIME OF THE DISTRIBUTION.  IF TDCC DETERMINES THAT THE EXCHANGE IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO BE CONSUMMATED AT THE TIME OF THE DISTRIBUTION, TDCC MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE THE SPINCO DEBT INSTRUMENTS IN ANY EVENT, OR ALTERNATIVELY, MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE CASH FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CASH AND DEBT DISTRIBUTION; HOWEVER TDCC HAS NO OBLIGATION TO WAIVE THE CONSUMMATION OF THE EXCHANGE AS A CONDITION TO THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. ON MARCH 26, 2015, OLIN AND CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXECUTED COMMITMENT LETTERS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE FINANCING TO SPINCO TO FINANCE THE AMOUNT OF THE CASH AND DEBT DISTRIBUTION AND TO PROVIDE FINANCING TO OLIN TO REFINANCE CERTAIN OF OLIN’S EXISTING DEBT, IN EACH CASE ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE COMMITMENT LETTERS.


AT TDCC’S ELECTION, THE DISTRIBUTION MAY BE EFFECTED BY MEANS OF A PRO RATA DIVIDEND IN A SPIN-OFF, AN EXCHANGE OFFER FOR OUTSTANDING TDCC SHARES IN A SPLIT-OFF, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF. 
 
 


  


  





  

 
 

THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT THE DISTRIBUTION IS SUBJECT TO THE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMULTANEOUS CONSUMMATION OF THE CASH AND DEBT DISTRIBUTION AND TO THE SATISFACTION OR WAIVER OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT.


THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT OLIN IS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT.


MERGER AGREEMENT


THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION, MERGER SUB WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO SPINCO, WITH SPINCO SURVIVING THE MERGER AS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF OLIN. AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER, EACH SHARE OF SPINCO COMMON STOCK WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE SHARES OF OLIN COMMON STOCK, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.


IN ADDITION, THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, OLIN WILL INCREASE THE SIZE OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE “OLIN BOARD”) BY THREE MEMBERS, AND THAT THREE INDIVIDUALS DESIGNATED BY TDCC WILL BE APPOINTED TO THE OLIN BOARD TO FILL THE VACANCIES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL ALSO BE NOMINATED FOR ELECTION TO THE OLIN BOARD AT OLIN’S NEXT ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS.


CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, (1) THE CONSUMMATION OF THE SEPARATION AND THE DISTRIBUTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT, (2) THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF ANY APPLICABLE WAITING PERIOD UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1976, AS AMENDED, AND THE RECEIPT OF REGULATORY APPROVALS IN CERTAIN OTHER JURISDICTIONS, (3)  THE EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS TO BE FILED WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (“SEC”), (4) THE APPROVAL BY OLIN’S SHAREHOLDERS OF THE ISSUANCE OF OLIN COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER (THE “SHARE ISSUANCE”) AND THE AMENDMENT OF OLIN’S AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF OLIN COMMON STOCK (THE “CHARTER AMENDMENT”), (5) THE RECEIPT BY TDCC OF A FAVORABLE IRS PRIVATE LETTER RULING WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE SEPARATION AND THE DISTRIBUTION AND AN OPINION FROM ITS COUNSEL WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS RELATED TO THE SEPARATION, DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE, (6) THE RECEIPT BY TDCC, ON THE ONE HAND, AND OLIN, ON THE OTHER HAND, OF AN OPINION FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNSEL TO THE EFFECT THAT THE MERGER WILL BE TREATED AS A “REORGANIZATION” FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, (7) THE CONSUMMATION OF THE EXCHANGE (UNLESS TDCC ELECTS TO RECEIVE CASH FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CASH AND DEBT DISTRIBUTION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE), (8) MATERIAL COMPLIANCE BY EACH PARTY WITH ITS COVENANTS, AND (9) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MATERIALITY QUALIFIERS, THE ABSENCE OF BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.


THE PARTIES HAVE MADE CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND AGREED TO VARIOUS CUSTOMARY COVENANTS IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, COVENANTS TO CONDUCT THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS AND OLIN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE BETWEEN THE EXECUTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER AND NOT TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIONS DURING SUCH PERIOD. TDCC COVENANTS IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT NOT TO SOLICIT OR ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING, OR PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH, ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS. OLIN ALSO COVENANTS IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT (1) TO CAUSE A SHAREHOLDER MEETING TO BE HELD TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL, (2) NOT TO SOLICIT ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS, (3) EXCEPT UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, NOT TO ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING, OR PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH, ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND (4) WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THAT THE OLIN BOARD WILL RECOMMEND THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS OF OLIN VOTE TO APPROVE THE SHARE ISSUANCE AND THE CHARTER AMENDMENT.
 
 


  


  





  


 
 
THE MERGER AGREEMENT CONTAINS CERTAIN TERMINATION RIGHTS FOR BOTH TDCC AND OLIN AND FURTHER PROVIDES THAT OLIN MUST PAY TO TDCC A TERMINATION FEE OF $100 MILLION UPON TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES:






  


·


IF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED BY TDCC DUE TO (A) A CHANGE IN THE OLIN BOARD’S RECOMMENDATION THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS OF OLIN VOTE TO APPROVE THE SHARE ISSUANCE AND THE CHARTER AMENDMENT; (B) A FAILURE BY OLIN TO INCLUDE SUCH FAVORABLE BOARD RECOMMENDATION IN THE PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE OLIN SHAREHOLDER VOTE; OR (C) THE FAILURE BY OLIN TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, OBTAINING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AND NOT SOLICITING OR PARTICIPATING IN ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OBLIGATIONS SUMMARIZED IN CLAUSES (1)-(4) OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PARAGRAPH;









  


·


IF (A) OLIN OR TDCC TERMINATES THE MERGER AGREEMENT FOR FAILURE TO CLOSE BEFORE THE TERMINATION DATE OR BECAUSE APPROVAL IS NOT OBTAINED AT THE OLIN SHAREHOLDER MEETING TO BE CALLED FOR SUCH PURPOSE; (B) PRIOR TO THE TERMINATION, A COMPETING TRANSACTION INVOLVING OLIN IS ANNOUNCED OR BECOMES PUBLICLY KNOWN; AND (C) WITHIN 18 MONTHS AFTER THE TERMINATION OLIN CONSUMMATES, OR ENTERS INTO AN AGREEMENT FOR, A COMPETING TRANSACTION.





IN ADDITION, IF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED BECAUSE APPROVAL IS NOT OBTAINED AT THE OLIN SHAREHOLDER MEETING CALLED FOR SUCH PURPOSE, OLIN HAS AGREED TO REIMBURSE TDCC AND SPINCO FOR EXPENSES UP TO A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF $50 MILLION.  IF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE SECOND BULLET ABOVE, THE TERMINATION FEE WILL BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF ANY SUCH EXPENSES PREVIOUSLY REIMBURSED BY OLIN.

IN THE EVENT OF A CONTESTED ELECTION OF DIRECTORS, WHICH IS A SITUATION WHERE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES FOR ELECTION EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF DIRECTORS TO BE ELECTED, DIRECTORS WILL BE ELECTED BY A PLURALITY OF THE VOTES CAST.  IF A NOMINEE FOR DIRECTOR THAT IS NOT AN INCUMBENT DIRECTOR DOES NOT RECEIVE THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF VOTES CAST IN AN UNCONTESTED ELECTION, HE OR SHE SHALL NOT BE ELECTED.  IF AN INCUMBENT DIRECTOR STANDING FOR RE-ELECTION FAILS TO RECEIVE THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF VOTES CAST IN AN UNCONTESTED ELECTION, HE OR SHE SHALL PROMPTLY TENDER HIS OR HER RESIGNATION TO THE BOARD. THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE WILL THEN RECOMMEND TO THE BOARD WHETHER TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE RESIGNATION, AND THE BOARD WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION AND PUBLICLY DISCLOSE ITS DETERMINATION WITHIN 90 DAYS FOLLOWING CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION RESULTS.  THE AMENDED BY-LAWS PROVIDE THAT IF THE RESIGNATION IS NOT ACCEPTED BY THE BOARD, THEN THE DIRECTOR CONTINUES TO SERVE UNTIL SUCH DIRECTOR'S SUCCESSOR IS ELECTED OR SUCH DIRECTOR IS REMOVED OR RESIGNS, AND THAT IF THE RESIGNATION IS ACCEPTED BY THE BOARD, THEN THE BOARD MAY FILL THE RESULTING VACANCY OR DECREASE THE SIZE OF THE BOARD.
ADVANCE NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS. THE AMENDED BY-LAWS REQUIRE NOMINATING STOCKHOLDERS TO DISCLOSE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR, AND THEIR AFFILIATES' AND ASSOCIATES', INTERESTS IN THE COMPANY, AND PROVIDE THAT THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS IS NOT LESS THAN 90 NOR MORE THAN 120 DAYS PRIOR TO THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE PRECEDING YEAR'S ANNUAL MEETING, WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS.
ANNUAL MEETING. THE AMENDED BY-LAWS PROVIDE THAT THE ANNUAL MEETING WILL BE HELD ON THE DATE, AND AT THE PLACE AND TIME, FIXED BY A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD.
EXCLUSIVE FORUM. THE AMENDED BY-LAWS DESIGNATE DELAWARE COURTS AS THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS, ACTIONS ASSERTING BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, ACTIONS ARISING PURSUANT TO PROVISIONS OF DELAWARE CORPORATE LAW, AND ACTIONS ASSERTING CLAIMS GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOCTRINE.
INDEMNIFICATION. THE AMENDED BY-LAWS INCLUDE A NUMBER OF CLARIFICATIONS AND AMENDMENTS TO THE PROVISIONS REGARDING INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE FACILITY WILL BE PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH FULL PRODUCTION OPERATIONS RESUMING SHORTLY THEREAFTER.

(“SPINCO”), A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TDCC. THE MERGER AND THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO THE MERGER ARE DESCRIBED IN OLIN’S REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-4 FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE “SEC”) ON MAY 8, 2015, AS AMENDED BY AMENDMENT NO. 1, FILED WITH THE SEC ON JUNE 22, 2015, AMENDMENT NO. 2, FILED WITH THE SEC ON JULY 16, 2015, AMENDMENT NO. 3, FILED WITH THE SEC ON AUGUST 12, 2015, AND AMENDMENT NO. 4, FILED WITH THE SEC ON AUGUST 14, 2015, ARE REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE “TRANSACTIONS”.

LOANS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE AVAILABLE UPON THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS (THE “CLOSING DATE”), SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CONDITIONS PRECEDENT FOR FACILITIES OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS (A) THE ACCURACY OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATED TO OLIN AND SPINCO, (B) THE ABSENCE OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BUSINESS, (C) THE SUBSTANTIALLY CONCURRENT CLOSING OF THE MERGER, (D) THE SUBSTANTIALLY CONCURRENT REFINANCING OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE “EXISTING JV CREDIT AGREEMENT”) GOVERNING THE EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS OF DOW-MITSUI CHLOR-ALKALI LLC, A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN TDCC AND MITSUI & CO.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON MARCH 27, 2015, OLIN CORPORATION (“OLIN”) AND THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY (“TDCC”) ANNOUNCED THAT THEY AND CERTAIN AFFILIATES HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE “MERGER AGREEMENT”) DATED MARCH 26, 2015 AMONG OLIN, TDCC, BLUE CUBE ACQUISITION CORP. (“MERGER SUB”) AND BLUE CUBE SPINCO INC. (“SPLITCO”), PURSUANT TO WHICH, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND A SEPARATION AGREEMENT DATED MARCH 26, 2015 BETWEEN TDCC AND SPLITCO,  (1) TDCC WILL TRANSFER ITS U.S. GULF COAST CHLOR-ALKALI AND VINYL, GLOBAL CHLORINATED ORGANICS AND GLOBAL EPOXY BUSINESSES TO SPLITCO, (2) TDCC WILL DISTRIBUTE SPLITCO’S STOCK TO TDCC’S SHAREHOLDERS BY WAY OF A SPLIT-OFF OR A COMBINATION OF A SPLIT-OFF AND A SPIN-OFF, AND (3) MERGER SUB WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO SPLITCO, WITH SPLITCO AS THE SURVIVING CORPORATION (THE “MERGER”).


ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2015, TDCC ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS COMMENCED AN EXCHANGE OFFER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH TDCC IS OFFERING TO TDCC SHAREHOLDERS THE RIGHT TO EXCHANGE ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $2.50 PER SHARE, OF TDCC (“TDCC COMMON STOCK”), FOR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE, OF SPLITCO (“SPLITCO COMMON STOCK”).  IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CONSUMMATION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER, MERGER SUB WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO SPLITCO IN THE MERGER, WHEREBY THE SEPARATE CORPORATE EXISTENCE OF MERGER SUB WILL CEASE AND SPLITCO WILL CONTINUE AS THE SURVIVING COMPANY AND A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF OLIN.  IN THE MERGER, EACH SHARE OF SPLITCO COMMON STOCK WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE 0.87482759 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $1 PER SHARE, OF OLIN (“OLIN COMMON STOCK”).  IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER, APPROXIMATELY 52.7% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OLIN COMMON STOCK ARE EXPECTED TO BE HELD BY PRE-MERGER HOLDERS OF SPLITCO COMMON STOCK AND APPROXIMATELY 47.3% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OLIN COMMON STOCK ARE EXPECTED TO BE HELD BY PRE-MERGER OLIN SHAREHOLDERS.


TDCC EXPECTS TO ISSUE 100,000,000 SHARES OF SPLITCO COMMON STOCK IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER, WHICH WILL BE CONVERTED IN THE MERGER INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY 87.5 MILLION SHARES OF OLIN COMMON STOCK.  THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF TDCC COMMON STOCK THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER WILL DEPEND ON THE FINAL EXCHANGE RATIO FOR THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF TDCC COMMON STOCK TENDERED.  THE EXCHANGE OFFER WILL BE SUBJECT TO PRORATION IF THE EXCHANGE OFFER IS OVERSUBSCRIBED, AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES ACCEPTED IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER MAY BE FEWER THAN THE NUMBER OF SHARES TENDERED.  IF THE EXCHANGE OFFER IS CONSUMMATED BUT NOT FULLY SUBSCRIBED, THEN THE REMAINING SHARES OF SPLITCO COMMON STOCK OWNED BY TDCC WILL BE DISTRIBUTED ON A PRO RATA BASIS TO TDCC SHAREHOLDERS WHOSE SHARES OF TDCC COMMON STOCK REMAIN OUTSTANDING AFTER THE CONSUMMATION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER.


THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 8:00 A.M., NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON OCTOBER 1, 2015, UNLESS THE EXCHANGE OFFER IS TERMINATED OR EXTENDED, AFTER WHICH EXPIRATION THE PARTIES EXPECT TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER.  THE TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING OLIN SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.


 





 
 
CALCULATION OF PER-SHARE VALUE


TDCC WILL DETERMINE THE PRICES AT WHICH SHARES OF TDCC COMMON STOCK AND SHARES OF SPLITCO COMMON STOCK (AND ULTIMATELY OLIN COMMON STOCK) WILL BE EXCHANGED BY REFERENCE TO THE SIMPLE ARITHMETIC AVERAGE OF THE DAILY VOLUME-WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICES OF TDCC COMMON STOCK AND OLIN COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE ON EACH OF THE LAST THREE TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER (NOT INCLUDING THE EXPIRATION DATE).  THE FINAL EXCHANGE RATIO SHOWING THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SPLITCO COMMON STOCK (WHICH WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE SHARES OF OLIN COMMON STOCK) THAT TDCC SHAREHOLDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER WILL RECEIVE FOR EACH SHARE OF TDCC COMMON STOCK ACCEPTED IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER WILL BE ANNOUNCED BY TDCC NO LATER THAN 4:30 P.M., NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON THE LAST TRADING DAY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE.


THE EXCHANGE OFFER IS DESIGNED TO PERMIT TDCC SHAREHOLDERS TO EXCHANGE THEIR SHARES OF TDCC COMMON STOCK FOR SHARES OF SPLITCO COMMON STOCK AT A DISCOUNT OF 10 PERCENT TO THE PER-SHARE VALUE OF OLIN COMMON STOCK, SUBJECT TO AN UPPER LIMIT OF AN AGGREGATE OF 2.9318 SHARES OF SPLITCO COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF TDCC COMMON STOCK ACCEPTED IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER.  THIS DISCOUNT MEANS THAT TDCC SHAREHOLDERS WHO EXCHANGE THEIR SHARES OF TDCC COMMON STOCK FOR SHARES OF SPLITCO COMMON STOCK ARE EXPECTED TO ULTIMATELY RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY $1.11 OF OLIN COMMON STOCK FOR EVERY $1.00 OF TDCC COMMON STOCK TENDERED AND ACCEPTED IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER, SUBJECT TO THE UPPER LIMIT DESCRIBED ABOVE.  IF THE UPPER LIMIT OF 2.9318 SHARES OF SPLITCO COMMON STOCK PER SHARE OF TDCC COMMON STOCK IS REACHED AS OF THE INITIAL EXPIRATION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER, THEN THE EXCHANGE OFFER WILL BE SUBJECT TO A MANDATORY EXTENSION OF TWO TRADING DAYS FOLLOWING THE ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED EXPIRATION DATE.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS FILED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.


AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON MARCH 27, 2015, OLIN CORPORATION (“OLIN”) AND THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY (“TDCC”) ANNOUNCED THAT THEY AND CERTAIN AFFILIATES HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE “MERGER AGREEMENT”) DATED MARCH 26, 2015 AMONG OLIN, TDCC, BLUE CUBE ACQUISITION CORP. (“MERGER SUB”) AND BLUE CUBE SPINCO INC. (“SPLITCO”), PURSUANT TO WHICH, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND A SEPARATION AGREEMENT DATED MARCH 26, 2015 BETWEEN TDCC AND SPLITCO,  (1) TDCC WILL TRANSFER ITS U.S. GULF COAST CHLOR-ALKALI AND VINYL, GLOBAL CHLORINATED ORGANICS AND GLOBAL EPOXY BUSINESSES TO SPLITCO, (2) TDCC WILL DISTRIBUTE SPLITCO’S STOCK TO TDCC’S SHAREHOLDERS BY WAY OF A SPLIT-OFF OR A COMBINATION OF A SPLIT-OFF AND A SPIN-OFF, AND (3) MERGER SUB WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO SPLITCO, WITH SPLITCO AS THE SURVIVING CORPORATION (THE “MERGER”). THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER IN OLIN’S REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-4 DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2015.


IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2015, SPLITCO COMMENCED A PRIVATE DEBT OFFERING (THE “PRIVATE PLACEMENT”) OF A PRINCIPAL AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1,500,000,000 OF SENIOR NOTES (THE “NOTES”) TO CERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS PURSUANT TO EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”). THE NOTES WILL BE GUARANTEED ON A SENIOR UNSECURED BASIS BY OLIN UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER.


IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT, OLIN DISCLOSED CERTAIN INFORMATION TO PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS IN A PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM DATED SEPTEMBER 15, 2015 (THE “PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM”). OLIN INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION UNDER THE HEADING “RISK FACTORS” IN THE PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM:


THIRD-PARTY TRANSPORTATION—OLIN RELIES, AND WILL CONTINUE TO RELY, HEAVILY ON THIRD-PARTY TRANSPORTATION, WHICH SUBJECTS IT TO RISKS AND COSTS THAT OLIN CANNOT CONTROL, AND WHICH RISKS AND COSTS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OLIN’S FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.


OLIN WILL RELY HEAVILY ON RAILROAD, BARGE AND OTHER SHIPPING COMPANIES TO TRANSPORT FINISHED PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS AND TO TRANSPORT RAW MATERIALS TO THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES USED BY EACH OF OLIN’S BUSINESSES. THESE TRANSPORT OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS HAZARDS AND RISKS, INCLUDING EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS, WORK STOPPAGES AND OPERATING HAZARDS, AS WELL AS INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE METHODS OF TRANSPORTATION OLIN UTILIZES AND WILL UTILIZE AFTER THE CONSUMMATION OF THE COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SHIPPING CHLORINE AND OTHER CHEMICALS BY RAILROAD AND BY BARGE, MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL, MORE STRINGENT AND MORE COSTLY REGULATIONS IN THE FUTURE. IF OLIN IS DELAYED OR UNABLE TO SHIP FINISHED PRODUCTS OR UNABLE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH NEW REGULATIONS OR PUBLIC POLICY CHANGES RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, OR THESE TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES’ FAILURE TO OPERATE PROPERLY, OR IF THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COST OF THESE SERVICES DUE TO NEW ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS, OR OTHERWISE, OLIN MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ARRANGE EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES AND TIMELY MEANS TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS OR SHIP GOODS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OLIN’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, FEDERAL LEGISLATION ENACTED IN 2008 MANDATES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL (“PTC”) TECHNOLOGY BY DECEMBER 31, 2015 ON RAILROAD LINES WHERE TOXIC-BY-INHALATION HAZARDOUS (“TIH”) MATERIALS, INCLUDING CHLORINE, ARE TRANSPORTED. SEVERAL THIRD-PARTY RAILROADS WHICH OLIN UTILIZES TO TRANSPORT CHLORINE AND OTHER CHEMICALS HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL NOT MEET THE DEADLINE TO INSTALL PTC SYSTEMS AND MAY CEASE SHIPMENT OF TIH MATERIALS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, UNLESS THE DEADLINE FOR INSTALLING PTC SYSTEMS IS EXTENDED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS. IF ANY THIRD-PARTY RAILROAD WHICH OLIN UTILIZES TO TRANSPORT CHLORINE AND OTHER CHEMICALS CEASES TO TRANSPORT TIH MATERIALS, OR IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COST OF SHIPPING TIH MATERIALS BY RAIL OR OTHERWISE, OLIN MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ARRANGE EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES AND TIMELY MEANS TO DELIVER ITS PRODUCTS OR AT ALL, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OLIN’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 





 
THE NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. UNLESS THEY ARE REGISTERED, THE NOTES MAY BE OFFERED ONLY IN TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ANALYZED THESE MISSTATEMENTS, AND, AFTER CONSULTING WITH MANAGEMENT, CONCLUDED ON AUGUST 9, 2015, THAT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2013 AND 2014, THE INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 29, 2015, SHOULD BE RESTATED AND THEREFORE SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON.

ON AUGUST 7, 2015, THE COMPANY DELAYED THE FILING OF ITS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 28, 2015 BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION. SONOCO EXPECTS TO FILE ITS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 28, 2015 AT THE SAME TIME IT FILES THE 2014 AMENDED ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K/A. BACKGROUNDIN JULY 2015, IN THE COURSE OF CLOSING ITS BOOKS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2015, THE COMPANY DISCOVERED CERTAIN ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES AT THE CONTRACT PACKAGING CENTER IN IRAPUATO, MEXICO, PART OF THE COMPANY'S DISPLAY AND PACKAGING SEGMENT. THESE IRREGULARITIES INVOLVED THE IRAPUATO FINANCE MANAGER; THE FULL EXTENT OF INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER EMPLOYEES IN THE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED. THESE IRREGULARITIES CONSISTED OF A PATTERN OF UNSUPPORTED JOURNAL ENTRIES AND OTHER ACTIONS WHICH MISSTATED REVENUE, COSTS OF SALES, TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, OTHER RECEIVABLES, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER, AND TRADE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE FOR REPORTING PERIODS DATING BACK TO 2011. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT OF THE IDENTIFIED ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES IS MATERIAL TO ANY REPORTING PERIOD PRIOR TO 2012. THE IRAPUATO PACKAGING CENTER COMMENCED OPERATIONS EARLY IN 2010 AND THOSE OPERATIONS WERE NOT FULLY TO SCALE UNTIL 2012. PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTIGATION INDICATE THAT NEITHER CASH NOR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS WERE AFFECTED. THE COMPANY'S ONGOING INVESTIGATION HAS LED TO THE PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION THAT THESE MISSTATEMENTS WERE MADE TO CONCEAL SHORTFALLS IN OPERATING PROFITS AT THE IRAPUATO PACKAGING CENTER. PROMPTLY UPON DISCOVERY, THE COMPANY REPORTED THESE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SELF-REPORTED THE MATTER TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. IN ADDITION, THE EXISTENCE OF THE MISSTATEMENTS AND THEIR EXPECTED MAGNITUDE WERE DISCLOSED PUBLICLY IN THE COMPANY'S PRELIMINARY SECOND QUARTER 2015 EARNINGS RELEASE ON JULY 16, 2015. UPON NOTIFICATION OF THE MISSTATEMENTS, THE COMPANY'S AUDIT COMMITTEE PROMPTLY INITIATED A FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE MATTER TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE MISSTATEMENTS, AND THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECT ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RETAINED INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY EXPERTS TO ASSIST WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS REGARDING INTERNAL CONTROLS AND REMEDIATIONIN LIGHT OF THE ABOVE MATTER RELATED TO ITS TWO PACK CENTER OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, HAS DETERMINED THAT AT LEAST ONE MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN SONOCO’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING EXISTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. SONOCO INTENDS TO RESTATE MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ITS EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECTS TO RECEIVE AN ADVERSE OPINION ON THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 FROM PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.ON OCTOBER 6, 2015, ALLEGHENY TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED (“ATI” OR THE “COMPANY”) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE COMMENTING ON THIRD QUARTER 2015 EXPECTED FINANCIAL RESULTS.  A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1. ITEM 8.01.     OTHER EVENTS.    EFFECTIVE WITH THE THIRD QUARTER 2015, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF DETERMINING BUSINESS UNIT PERFORMANCE AS INTERNALLY REPORTED TO ITS SENIOR MANAGEMENT, CEO, AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT IS NOW REPORTED EXCLUDING ALL EFFECTS OF LIFO INVENTORY ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED CHANGES IN NET REALIZABLE VALUE INVENTORY RESERVES WHICH OFFSET THE COMPANY’S AGGREGATE NET DEBIT LIFO VALUATION BALANCE.   ADDITIONALLY, SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT IS NOW MEASURED INCLUDING ALL RETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BUSINESS UNIT, FOR BOTH CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES.  PREVIOUSLY, ATI EXCLUDED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION EXPENSE AND ALL DEFINED BENEFIT AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE EXPENSE FROM SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT.  THIS CHANGE BETTER ALIGNS COMPARATIVE OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOLLOWING THE 2014 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION FREEZE FOR ALL NON-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES AND THE CHANGE IN 2015 TO A COMPANY-WIDE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLAN STRUCTURE.  UNDER THE COMPANY’S PREVIOUS REPORTING METHODOLOGY, DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLAN EXPENSE REMAINED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS WHEREAS DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN COSTS WERE EXCLUDED.  OPERATING RESULTS FOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS, CORPORATE AND CLOSED COMPANY AND OTHER EXPENSES NOW INCLUDE ALL APPLICABLE RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN COSTS FOR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE CHANGES TO BE A MORE USEFUL METHOD OF MEASURING BUSINESS UNIT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BASED ON CHANGES TO RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AND THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY’S AGGREGATE NET DEBIT LIFO POSITION.  THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT REPORTING INFORMATION REFLECTS THIS NEW INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING BASIS OF SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT AND IS FILED AS PART OF THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K.SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)         FOR THE SIX MONTHS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED ENDED JUNE 30, JUNE 30, MARCH 31, JUNE 30, 2015 2014 2015 2015 2014SALES:           HIGH PERFORMANCE MATERIALS & COMPONENTS$1,053.9 $998.5 $511.1 $542.8 $514.1  FLAT ROLLED PRODUCTS1,094.1 1,107.8 511.4 582.7 604.9TOTAL SALES$2,148.0 $2,106.3 $1,022.5 $1,125.5 $1,119.0          OPERATING PROFIT (LOSS):           HIGH PERFORMANCE MATERIALS & COMPONENTS$117.3 $108.7 $44.4 $72.9 $52.7  % OF SALES11.1 % 10.9 % 8.7 % 13.4 % 10.3 %            FLAT ROLLED PRODUCTS(30.0) (38.8) (23.2) (6.8) (5.6)  % OF SALES(2.7)% (3.5)% (4.5)% (1.2)% (0.9)%          TOTAL OPERATING PROFIT87.3 69.9 21.2 66.1 47.1  % OF SALES4.1 % 3.3 % 2.1 % 5.9 % 4.2 %          LIFO AND NET REALIZABLE VALUE RESERVES0.2 (2.9) 0.2 — (2.9)CORPORATE EXPENSES(22.9) (25.9) (10.1) (12.8) (13.0)CLOSED COMPANY AND OTHER EXPENSES(12.1) (12.9) (6.1) (6.0) (6.1)RESTRUCTURING COSTS— — — — —INTEREST EXPENSE, NET(53.5) (57.6) (26.8) (26.7) (28.5)          INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES$(1.0) $(29.4) $(21.6) $20.6 $(3.4)           FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010SALES:           HIGH PERFORMANCE MATERIALS & COMPONENTS$2,006.8 $1,944.8 $2,314.0 $2,081.0 $1,422.8  FLAT ROLLED PRODUCTS2,216.6 2,098.7 2,352.9 2,731.3 2,343.4TOTAL SALES$4,223.4 $4,043.5 $4,666.9 $4,812.3 $3,766.2          OPERATING PROFIT (LOSS):           HIGH PERFORMANCE MATERIALS & COMPONENTS$234.8 $159.6 $315.7 $367.7 $230.2  % OF SALES11.7 % 8.2 % 13.6 % 17.7 % 16.2 %            FLAT ROLLED PRODUCTS(47.0) (147.8) 19.7 136.0 103.8  % OF SALES(2.1)% (7.0)% 0.8 % 5 % 4.4 %          TOTAL OPERATING PROFIT187.8 11.8 335.4 503.7 334.0  % OF SALES4.4 % 0.3 % 7.2 % 10.5 % 8.9 %          LIFO AND NET REALIZABLE VALUE RESERVES0.3 45.9 75.6 25.9 (54.8)CORPORATE EXPENSES(49.6) (48.9) (75.6) (98.1) (69.3)CLOSED COMPANY AND OTHER EXPENSES(28.3) (30.9) (31.5) (17.1) (23.0)RESTRUCTURING COSTS— (67.5) — — —INTEREST EXPENSE, NET(108.7) (65.2) (71.6) (92.3) (62.7)          INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES$1.5 $(154.8) $232.3 $322.1 $124.2",ATI

RE:                           ROYAL GOLD, INC. ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  NOVEMBER 11, 2015
PROPOSAL 3, ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
DEAR STOCKHOLDER:
 
BY NOW YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED ROYAL GOLD, INC.S NOTICE OF THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING AND PROXY STATEMENT.  YOU ALSO CAN VIEW THE PROXY STATEMENT AT WWW.ROYALGOLD.COM.
 
MY NAME IS CRAIG HAASE, AND I AM CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPENSATION, NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE (COMMITTEE) OF ROYAL GOLDS BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOARD). THE BOARD IS PROUD OF ROYAL GOLDS MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS DURING FISCAL YEAR 2015, INCLUDING A RECORD VOLUME OF GOLD EQUIVALENT OUNCES OF PRODUCTION, RECORD OPERATING CASH FLOW, INCREASED REVENUE AND AN INCREASED DIVIDEND, ALL DESPITE THE PREVAILING DEPRESSED GOLD PRICE ENVIRONMENT. MORE ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE PROXY SUMMARY FOUND ON PAGE II OF THE PROXY STATEMENT.
 
I WRITE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE, ASKING FOR YOUR CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH FOLLOWS, AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT AT THE ANNUAL MEETING BY VOTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BOARD ON ALL PROPOSALS, INCLUDING PROPOSAL 3, ADVISORY VOTE ON COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS SAY ON PAY).
 
PROXY ADVISOR GLASS LEWIS RECOMMENDED A VOTE FOR SAY ON PAY, WHILE INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES (ISS) RECOMMENDED AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL. GLASS LEWIS COMPARED ROYAL GOLDS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TO GOLD COMPANIES WITH MARKET CAPITALIZATIONS SIMILAR TO ROYAL GOLD. THEIR BENCHMARKING GROUP COMPRISES THE PEERS SELECTED BY ROYAL GOLD, AND THE COMMITTEE AGREES THAT THIS BENCHMARK GROUP PROVIDES AN APPROPRIATE BASIS FOR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMPARISON.
 
THE COMMITTEE STRONGLY DISAGREES WITH THE ISS RECOMMENDATION, WHICH IT BELIEVES TO BE BASED ON A MISLEADING COMPARISON OF ROYAL GOLDS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AGAINST AN ISS-SELECTED GROUP OF COMPANIES THAT SIMPLY ARE NOT COMPARABLE FROM AN INDUSTRY, BUSINESS MODEL OR MARKET CAPITALIZATION PERSPECTIVE.
 
AFTER REVIEWING THE INFORMATION BELOW, THE COMMITTEE IS CONFIDENT YOU WILL AGREE THAT THE ISS METHODOLOGY:
 
·                  FAILED TO COMPARE ROYAL GOLD TO ANY OTHER COMPANY IN THE VERY UNIQUE PRECIOUS METAL ROYALTY AND STREAMING BUSINESS;
 
·                  PRODUCED A BENCHMARK GROUP OF TWELVE COMPANIES, ONLY TWO OF WHICH ARE PRECIOUS METALS COMPANIES;
 
·                  DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT METRICS OTHER THAN REVENUE MAY BE APPROPRIATE PEER SELECTION TOOLS;
 
·                  DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT A ROYALTY COMPANYS UNIQUE COST STRUCTURE PROVIDES EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH MARGINS ON SMALLER REVENUES THAN THE SELECTED PEERS;
 
·                  SUGGESTS THAT COMPANIES AVERAGING ONE-EIGHTH THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF ROYAL GOLD ARE RELEVANT BENCHMARK PEERS;
 
·                  PRODUCED A BENCHMARK GROUP WHOSE SHARE PRICES HAVE NO MEANINGFUL CORRELATION TO GOLD PRICES AND ARE GENERALLY COUNTERCYCLICAL TO PRECIOUS METALS COMPANY SHARE PRICES MEANING THAT ROYAL GOLDS SHAREHOLDER RETURNS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO ALIGN WELL WITH COMPANIES OUTSIDE THE GOLD INDUSTRY WHEN, AS IS TRUE TODAY, GOLD IS DEPRESSED AND THE BROADER MARKET IS RELATIVELY STRONGER; AND
 
·                  RESULTED IN AN UNFAIR AND MISLEADING COMPARISON OF ROYAL GOLDS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM AGAINST A BENCHMARK PEER GROUP OF COMPANIES BEARING LITTLE, IF ANY, RESEMBLANCE TO ROYAL GOLD.
 
2





 
THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT COMPARISON OF ROYAL GOLDS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AGAINST A VALID PEER GROUP CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES STRONG PAY AND PERFORMANCE ALIGNMENT RELATIVE TO ROYAL GOLDS TRUE PEERS.
 
EACH OF THESE ITEMS IS EXPLAINED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.
 
ROYAL GOLD SELECTS PEERS THAT ACCURATELY REFLECT ITS BUSINESS MODEL, MARKET CAPITALIZATION, EBITDA AND CORRELATION TO GOLD PRICE.
 
ROYAL GOLDS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION BENCHMARKING PEER GROUP WAS ESTABLISHED IN FISCAL YEAR 2013 FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATION BY ROYAL GOLDS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION CONSULTANT AT THE TIME, FREDERIC W. COOK & CO., WITH INPUT FROM THE COMMITTEE AND MANAGEMENT. THE GROUP WAS REVIEWED AND CONFIRMED BY TOWERS WATSON IN FISCAL YEAR 2014, AND AGAIN BY ROYAL GOLDS CURRENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT, HUGESSEN CONSULTING, IN FISCAL YEAR 2015.
 
ROYAL GOLDS COMPENSATION PEERS ARE SELECTED BASED PRIMARILY ON STRONG BUSINESS MODEL MATCHES. ALL OF OUR PEERS ARE EITHER GOLD AND SILVER ROYALTY AND STREAMING COMPANIES, OR GOLD AND SILVER MINING COMPANIES. OTHER CRITERIA USED IN THE SELECTION PROCESS INCLUDE EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA), MARKET CAPITALIZATION AND SHARE PRICE CORRELATION TO GOLD PRICES. THESE CRITERIA LED TO THE SELECTION OF TODAYS BENCHMARKING PEER GROUP CONSISTING OF 11 PUBLICLY TRADED PRECIOUS METALS COMPANIES: AGNICO EAGLE MINES LIMITED, ALAMOS GOLD INC., CENTERRA GOLD INC., COEUR MINING, INC., ELDORADO GOLD CORPORATION, FRANCO-NEVADA CORPORATION, HECLA MINING COMPANY, IAMGOLD CORPORATION, NEW GOLD INC., PAN AMERICAN SILVER CORP. AND SILVER WHEATON CORP.
 
THE COMMITTEE IS CONVINCED THAT THIS IS THE RELEVANT COMPARATOR GROUP BECAUSE:
 
·                  ROYAL GOLDS EBITDA IS IN THE 41ST PERCENTILE OF THE PEER GROUP. WE BELIEVE EBITDA IS ONE OF THE BEST MEASURES FOR COMPARING ROYAL GOLD TO PEERS DUE TO ITS UNIQUE BUSINESS MODELOVER 75% OF ROYAL GOLDS REVENUE REPORTED TO EBITDA IN FISCAL YEAR 2015;
 
·                  ROYAL GOLDS MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS NEAR THE 70TH PERCENTILE OF ITS PEERS. COMPANIES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY POSSESSING SIMILAR MARKET CAPITALIZATION TEND TO HAVE SIMILAR LEVELS OF COMPENSATION;
 
·                  GOLD INDUSTRY PEERS SHARE ROYAL GOLDS CORRELATION BETWEEN COMPANY SHARE PRICE AND GOLD PRICES. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POINT WHEN COMPARING ROYAL GOLDS EXECUTIVE PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES. BECAUSE PRECIOUS METALS PRICES, AND THE STOCK PRICES OF PRECIOUS METALS MINING COMPANIES, ARE OFTEN COUNTERCYCLICAL TO THE BROADER MARKET, THE SHAREHOLDER RETURNS OF PRECIOUS METALS COMPANIES TEND TO COMPARE WELL WITH EACH OTHER BUT NOT TO THE BROADER MARKET. WE SEE THIS SITUATION TODAY, AND WE BELIEVE THAT ISS COMPARISON OF ROYAL GOLDS SHAREHOLDER RETURN WITH THOSE OF COMPANIES IN UNRELATED INDUSTRIES IS INAPPROPRIATE AND MISLEADING; AND
 
·                  GOLD MINING COMPANIES REPRESENT THE CLOSEST COMPETITIVE MARKET FOR EXECUTIVE TALENT. SINCE 2007, ROYAL GOLD HAS HIRED ELEVEN SENIOR- AND MANAGER-LEVEL EMPLOYEES FORMERLY EMPLOYED BY MAJOR GOLD PRODUCERSA SIGNIFICANT FACT GIVEN THAT ROYAL GOLD TODAY EMPLOYS ONLY 21 INDIVIDUALS.
 
ISS SELECTS BENCHMARKING PEERS USING ONLY TWO CRITERIA. ISS METHODOLOGY EXCLUDES ROYAL GOLDS TRUE PEERS, AND INCLUDES COMPANIES LIKE TIMBER AND CHEMICAL COMPANIES THAT ARE IRRELEVANT TO ROYAL GOLDS BUSINESS, WHICH LEADS TO INCONSISTENT PEER GROUP COMPOSITION THAT UNDERMINES THE VALIDITY OF ISSS QUANTITATIVE PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.
 
WE ACCEPT THAT ISS MUST OBSERVE INTERNAL PROTOCOLS FOR ESTABLISHING A BENCHMARKING PEER GROUP FOR ROYAL GOLD. THESE PROTOCOLS REQUIRE ISS TO SCREEN FIRST FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES IN THE SAME GLOBAL INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION STANDARD INDUSTRY CODE AS ROYAL GOLD, AND THEN TO SCREEN THESE COMPANIES BY ANNUAL REVENUE. HOWEVER, THE METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED BY ISS HAS PRODUCED BENCHMARK PEER GROUPS THAT:
 
·                  DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PRECIOUS METALS ROYALTY OR STREAM COMPANIES. NO COMPETITORS OF ROYAL GOLD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN AN ISS-SELECTED BENCHMARK PEER GROUP;
 
·                  SINCE 2013 HAVE INCLUDED AS MANY AS SEVEN AND AS FEW AS TWO PRECIOUS METALS COMPANIES. FIVE GOLD MINING COMPANIES WERE ELIMINATED FROM THE 2014 ISS-SELECTED PEER GROUP TO FORM THE 2015 GROUP, AND NEITHER OF THE TWO REMAINING 2015 ISS-SELECTED PEERS IN THE PRECIOUS METALS BUSINESS ARE PRIMARILY GOLD MINERS; AND
 
·                  HAVE BEEN COMPRISED OF COMPANIES IN THE SPECIALTY CHEMICALS, BUILDING MATERIALS, BASE METALS, METAL ALLOYS, FOREST PRODUCTS, PAPER, COATINGS AND LIMESTONE INDUSTRIES. NONE OF THESE INDUSTRIES ARE SIMILAR, OR EVEN RELEVANT, TO PRECIOUS METALS MINING GENERALLY, OR TO THE PRECIOUS METALS ROYALTY BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR.
 
3





 
EBITDA AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION ARE BETTER BENCHMARKING PEER GROUP SELECTION TOOLS THAN REVENUE.
 
AS INDICATED ABOVE, ISS USES ANNUAL REVENUE AS A SECOND PEER GROUP SCREEN. HOWEVER, THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT REVENUE IS NOT A TRUE MEASURE OF SIZE FOR ROYAL GOLD. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT EBITDA AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION ARE BETTER MEASURES FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS, AMONG OTHERS:
 
·                  ROYAL GOLDS BUSINESS MODEL IS EXTREMELY EFFICIENT. MORE THAN 75% OF ROYAL GOLDS REVENUE REPORTED TO EBITDA IN FISCAL 2015. OUR INVESTORS UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MODEL PROVIDES VERY LOW OPERATING COSTS AND SUPERIOR OPERATING MARGINS COMPARED TO MINING AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES;
 
·                  ROYAL GOLDS FISCAL YEAR 2015 EBITDA COMPARES WELL TO THE MEDIAN OF ITS SELF-SELECTED PEERS AND THAT OF THE PEERS SELECTED BY GLASS LEWIS:
 



   
 
·                  MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO STOCKHOLDER BENEFIT.
 
·                  COMPANIES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY POSSESSING SIMILAR MARKET CAPITALIZATION NATURALLY TEND TO AWARD SIMILAR LEVELS OF COMPENSATION, WHILE COMPANIES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY POSSESSING MUCH DIFFERENT MARKET CAPITALIZATION TEND TO PROVIDE DISPARATE COMPENSATION.
 
THE AVERAGE MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF THE 2015 ISS-SELECTED PEER GROUP IS APPROXIMATELY ONE-EIGHTH THAT OF ROYAL GOLD AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, AS DEMONSTRATED IN THE FOLLOWING CHART:
 



   
 
BECAUSE ISS METHODOLOGY SELECTS MOSTLY COMPANIES WITH MUCH SMALLER MARKET CAPITALIZATION THAN ROYAL GOLD, IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT ISS VIEWS ROYAL GOLDS CEO COMPENSATION AS BEING HIGHER RELATIVE TO THE ISS-SELECTED PEERS.  BY CONTRAST, ROYAL GOLDS MARKET CAPITALIZATION AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, RANKED IN THE 67TH PERCENTILE OF ITS SELF-SELECTED BENCHMARK PEER GROUP.
 
4





 
SHARE PRICE CORRELATION TO GOLD PRICE ALSO IS A VALID SELECTION TOOL FOR ESTABLISHING A BENCHMARK PEER GROUP FOR ROYAL GOLD.
 
PRECIOUS METALS COMPANY STOCK PRICES GENERALLY HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO GOLD AND SILVER PRICES. HOWEVER, GOLD AND SILVER PRICES, AND PRECIOUS METALS COMPANY STOCK PRICES, ARE OFTEN CONTRARIAN INVESTMENTS IN THE BROADER MARKETHIGHER WHEN THE BROADER MARKET IS DOWN, AND LOWER WHEN THE BROADER MARKET IS UP. AS OUR INDUSTRY IS OFTEN COUNTERCYCLICAL TO THE BROADER MARKET, WE BELIEVE IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND MISLEADING TO COMPARE ROYAL GOLDS TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN WITH COMPANIES WHO HAVE NO OR NEGATIVE CORRELATION TO GOLD PRICES.
 
TO DEMONSTRATE THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS POINT, ROYAL GOLDS SHARE PRICE HAD AN 89% CORRELATION TO THE PRICE OF GOLD DURING ITS 2015 FISCAL YEAR. THE CHART BELOW ILLUSTRATES THAT ROYAL GOLDS CORRELATION TO GOLD PRICE COMPARES VERY WELL WITH THAT OF ITS SELF-SELECTED PEER GROUP AND THE PEERS SELECTED BY GLASS LEWIS, WHILE THE ISS-SELECTED PEERS, AS A GROUP, HAD AN EXTREMELY WEAK 4% CORRELATION TO GOLD:
 



   
 
THE IMPORTANCE TO ROYAL GOLD OF SELECTING BENCHMARK PEER GROUPS COMPRISED OF GOLD COMPANIES IS UNMISTAKABLE. GOLD PRICES HAVE BEEN FALLING SINCE LATE CALENDAR YEAR 2012, WHILE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BROADER MARKET HAS IMPROVED. COMPARISON OF ROYAL GOLDS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION WITH BENCHMARK PEER GROUPS COMPRISED PREDOMINANTLY BY COMPANIES OUTSIDE THE GOLD INDUSTRY, SUCH AS THE ISS-SELECTED PEER GROUP, WILL YIELD MISLEADING RESULTS.
 
USING THE ROYAL GOLD-SELECTED BENCHMARK PEER GROUP CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES PAY FOR PERFORMANCE ALIGNMENT.
 
WHEN A BENCHMARKING PEER GROUP THAT TRULY REFLECTS ROYAL GOLDS BUSINESS MODEL AND INDUSTRY PROFILE IS USED TO COMPARE ROYAL GOLDS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, THE RELATIVE ALIGNMENT OF ROYAL GOLDS PAY WITH PERFORMANCE IS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED, AS PRESENTED BELOW.
 



   
 
THE COMMITTEES CONVICTION THAT IT HAS SELECTED AN APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKING PEER GROUP IS BORNE OUT BY TWO YEARS OF STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. MANY OF OUR LARGEST INVESTORS HAVE CONSISTENTLY INDICATED DURING ENGAGEMENT THAT THEY CONSIDER OUR GOLD-FOCUSED PEER GROUP TO BE THE MOST RELEVANT AND APPROPRIATE FOR COMPENSATION BENCHMARKING PURPOSES.
 
5





 
MOREOVER, GLASS LEWIS INDEPENDENTLY USED THE ROYAL GOLD BENCHMARKING PEER GROUP, PLUS SEVERAL ADDITIONAL GOLD MINING COMPANIES, TO ANALYZE ROYAL GOLDS PAY AND PERFORMANCE ALIGNMENT. GLASS LEWIS FOUND SOLID ALIGNMENT BETWEEN ROYAL GOLDS PAY AND PERFORMANCE, AND RECOMMENDED FOR SAY-ON-PAY.
 
WE INVITE YOU TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE REASONS THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 3, ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.
 
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION ON THESE MATTERS AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BOARDS RECOMMENDATION.

2016 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.  OVERVIEW. 
AT ITS MEETING ON FEBRUARY 25, 2016, THE PERSONNEL AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE COMMITTEE) OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
ALLEGHENY TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED (ATI OR THE COMPANY) TOOK A NUMBER OF ACTIONS CONCERNING COMPENSATION AND INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR 2016 AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIODS BEGINNING IN 2016 FOR THE COMPANYS CEO
AND NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (NEOS).  THE COMMITTEE TOOK A CLEAN SHEET APPROACH TO THE REDESIGN OF THE EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR 2016, AS AN OUTGROWTH TO THE COMPANYS TRANSFORMATION AND STRATEGIC CAPITAL INVESTMENTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND AS A RESULT OF PRIOR SAY ON PAY VOTES. THE COMMITTEES ACTIONS WERE GUIDED BY SUBSTANTIAL
FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM STOCKHOLDERS AND GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY COMPENSATION CONSULTANTS ON BEST PRACTICES. THE NEW EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO BE MORE ALIGNED WITH STOCKHOLDERS INTERESTS, MORE TRANSPARENT, EASIER TO UNDERSTAND,
RETENTIVE, AND FOCUSED ON ATIS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS DRIVING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF FINANCIAL GOALS AND EMPHASIZING ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF ATIS MANAGEMENT AND ATIS STOCKHOLDERS. 
THE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN (APP) AND THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP), WHICH HAS TWO
COMPONENTS.  THE APP:   


 

 
FOCUSES ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE GOALS;   


 

 
WEIGHTS FINANCIAL GOALS AT 90% AND STRATEGIC/INDIVIDUAL GOALS AT 10% FOR THE CEO AND OTHER NEOS;   


 

 
IMPOSES A MINIMUM CASH FLOW TARGET AS A PREREQUISITE TO TRIGGER PAYMENT FOR ACHIEVEMENT OF STRATEGIC/INDIVIDUAL GOALS; AND

STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES: 
ADDITIONALLY, THE COMMITTEE APPROVED NEW STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS BASED ON TARGETING ACTUAL OWNERSHIP AS A MULTIPLE OF BASE SALARY.
EFFECTIVE FOR 2016, THE NEW STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CEO, OTHER NEOS, AND OTHER EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE AS FOLLOWS:   


 

 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER: 6 TIMES BASE SALARY   


 

 
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENTS: 3 TIMES BASE SALARY   


 

 
SENIOR VICE PRESIDENTS: 2 TIMES BASE SALARY  EXECUTIVES ARE REQUIRED TO RETAIN 100% OF THE
AFTER-TAX VALUE OF SHARES ISSUED UPON THE VESTING OF PSUS AND RSUS UNTIL THE OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENT IS SATISFIED.  THIS CHANGE, FROM A
FIXED NUMBER OF SHARES AS THE METHOD OF DETERMINING OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE TO TARGETING A MULTIPLE OF BASE SALARY, REQUIRES A MEANINGFUL LEVEL OF STOCK OWNERSHIP FOR THE CEO AND ALL NEOS EVEN DURING THE CYCLICALITY IN OUR MARKETS AND DECLINING STOCK
PRICE.

HOWEVER, THE STARTING POINTS FOR APPLYING THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH RATES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PCSUS GRANTED IN 2013, 2014, AND 2015, WERE UPDATED TO REFLECT THE RESTATED BEPS. IN ADDITION, THE COMMITTEE MODIFIED THE CALCULATION OF 2015 BEPS BY INCLUDING THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF LEGAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH IRAPUATO. 5",SON

TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT  ON
SEPTEMBER 22, 2016, ASHLAND AND VALVOLINE ENTERED INTO A TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT THAT GOVERNS THE RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF ASHLAND AND VALVOLINE AFTER THE CLOSING OF THE IPO WITH RESPECT TO ALL TAX MATTERS (INCLUDING TAX
LIABILITIES, TAX ATTRIBUTES, TAX RETURNS AND TAX CONTESTS) (THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT).  VALVOLINE WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE
U.S. FEDERAL CONSOLIDATED GROUP TAX RETURN, AND POSSIBLY CERTAIN COMBINED OR SIMILAR GROUP TAX RETURNS, WITH ASHLAND (THE ASHLAND GROUP RETURNS) FOR THE PERIOD STARTING APPROXIMATELY ON THE DATE OF THE CLOSING OF THE IPO AND THROUGH THE
DATE OF THE DISTRIBUTION BY ASHLAND TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS OF ASHLANDS REMAINING SHARES OF VALVOLINE COMMON STOCK. WE REFER TO THIS PERIOD AS THE INTERIM PERIOD AND TO THIS DISTRIBUTION AS THE FINAL SEPARATION. UNDER
THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT, ASHLAND WILL GENERALLY MAKE ALL NECESSARY TAX PAYMENTS TO THE RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES WITH RESPECT TO ASHLAND GROUP RETURNS, AND VALVOLINE WILL MAKE TAX SHARING PAYMENTS TO ASHLAND. THE AMOUNT OF VALVOLINES TAX
SHARING PAYMENTS WILL GENERALLY BE DETERMINED AS IF VALVOLINE AND EACH OF ITS RELEVANT SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDED IN THE ASHLAND GROUP RETURNS FILED ITS OWN CONSOLIDATED, COMBINED OR SEPARATE TAX RETURNS FOR THE INTERIM PERIOD THAT INCLUDE ONLY VALVOLINE
AND/OR ITS RELEVANT SUBSIDIARIES, AS THE CASE MAY BE.  FOR TAXABLE PERIODS THAT BEGIN ON OR AFTER THE DAY AFTER THE DATE OF THE FINAL
SEPARATION, VALVOLINE WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED IN ANY ASHLAND GROUP RETURNS AND WILL FILE TAX RETURNS THAT INCLUDE ONLY VALVOLINE AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AS APPROPRIATE. VALVOLINE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO MAKE TAX SHARING PAYMENTS TO ASHLAND FOR
THOSE TAXABLE PERIODS. NEVERTHELESS, VALVOLINE HAS (AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE FOLLOWING THE FINAL SEPARATION) JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY WITH ASHLAND TO THE IRS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES OF THE ASHLAND CONSOLIDATED GROUP FOR
THE TAXABLE PERIODS IN WHICH VALVOLINE WAS PART OF THE ASHLAND CONSOLIDATED GROUP. 


THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT ALSO GENERALLY PROVIDES THAT VALVOLINE WILL INDEMNIFY ASHLAND FOR THE
FOLLOWING TAXES:   


 

 
TAXES OF VALVOLINE FOR ALL TAXABLE PERIODS THAT BEGIN ON OR AFTER THE DAY AFTER THE DATE OF THE FINAL SEPARATION;   


 

 
TAXES OF VALVOLINE INC. FOR THE INTERIM PERIOD, AND TAXES OF SUBSIDIARIES OF VALVOLINE INC. FOR ALL TAXABLE PERIODS THAT END ON OR BEFORE THE DATE OF THE FINAL SEPARATION, THAT ARE NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ASHLAND GROUP
RETURNS;   


 

 
TAXES FOR ANY TAX PERIOD PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE IPO (THE PRE-IPO PERIOD) THAT ARISE ON AUDIT OR EXAMINATION AND ARE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VALVOLINE BUSINESS; 
 


 

 
CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL TAXES FOR THE PRE-IPO PERIOD OF ASHLAND AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR THAT PERIOD THAT ARISE ON AUDIT OR EXAMINATION AND ARE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEITHER THE VALVOLINE BUSINESS NOR
THE ASHLAND BUSINESSES; AND   


 

 
TRANSACTION TAXES (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) THAT ARE ALLOCATED TO VALVOLINE UNDER THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT. 
THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES THAT VALVOLINE WILL INDEMNIFY ASHLAND FOR ANY TAXES (AND REASONABLE EXPENSES) RESULTING FROM THE
FAILURE OF THE FINAL SEPARATION TO QUALIFY FOR NON-RECOGNITION OF GAIN AND LOSS OR CERTAIN REORGANIZATION TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO THE SEPARATION OR THE FINAL SEPARATION TO QUALIFY FOR THEIR INTENDED TAX TREATMENT (TRANSACTION TAXES),
WHERE THE TAXES RESULT FROM (1) BREACHES OF COVENANTS THAT VALVOLINE HAS AGREED TO IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING COVENANTS CONTAINING THE RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED BELOW THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE TAX-FREE NATURE OF THE FINAL
SEPARATION), (2) THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW TO THE FINAL SEPARATION WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS OF VALVOLINES COMMON STOCK OR (3) ANY OTHER ACTIONS THAT VALVOLINE KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD EXPECT
WOULD GIVE RISE TO SUCH TAXES. THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRES VALVOLINE TO INDEMNIFY ASHLAND FOR A PORTION OF CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTION TAXES ALLOCATED TO VALVOLINE BASED ON VALVOLINES MARKET CAPITALIZATION RELATIVE TO THE MARKET
CAPITALIZATION OF ASHLAND.  VALVOLINE WILL GENERALLY HAVE EITHER SOLE CONTROL, OR JOINT CONTROL WITH ASHLAND, OVER ANY AUDIT OR
EXAMINATION RELATED TO TAXES FOR WHICH VALVOLINE IS REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY ASHLAND.  THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT IMPOSES CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS
ON VALVOLINE AND VALVOLINES SUBSIDIARIES (INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON SHARE ISSUANCES OR REPURCHASES, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, SALES OF ASSETS, AND SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS) THAT WILL BE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE TAX-FREE NATURE OF THE FINAL
SEPARATION. THESE RESTRICTIONS WILL APPLY FOR THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD AFTER THE FINAL SEPARATION. HOWEVER, VALVOLINE WILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN AN OTHERWISE RESTRICTED ACTION IF VALVOLINE OBTAINS AN APPROPRIATE OPINION FROM COUNSEL OR RULING FROM THE
IRS.  THE TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 10.4 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. 
EMPLOYEE MATTERS AGREEMENT  ON
SEPTEMBER 22, 2016, ASHLAND AND VALVOLINE ENTERED INTO AN EMPLOYEE MATTERS AGREEMENT THAT ADDRESSES EMPLOYMENT, COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS MATTERS, INCLUDING THE ALLOCATION AND TREATMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATING TO VALVOLINES

THE IPO AND PRIOR TO THE FINAL SEPARATION, VALVOLINE WILL ESTABLISH BENEFIT PLANS FOR ITS EMPLOYEES THAT GENERALLY WILL RECOGNIZE ALL SERVICE, COMPENSATION AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING BENEFIT DETERMINATIONS TO THE SAME EXTENT RECOGNIZED UNDER THE
CORRESPONDING ASHLAND BENEFIT PLAN. UNTIL SUCH TIME, CLAIMS INCURRED BY VALVOLINES EMPLOYEES WILL CONTINUE TO BE COVERED UNDER ASHLANDS BENEFIT PLANS, AND VALVOLINE WILL REIMBURSE ASHLAND FOR SUCH COSTS IF THEY ARE NOT OTHERWISE CHARGED
TO VALVOLINE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE.  PENSION AND RETIREMENT PLANS. VALVOLINE HAS ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN ASHLAND
QUALIFIED AND NONQUALIFIED PENSION AND RETIREMENT PLANS AS WELL AS A PORTION OF THE TRUSTS OR OTHER FUNDING VEHICLES THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO FUND SUCH PLANS. SPECIFICALLY, PRIOR TO THE IPO, VALVOLINE ASSUMED ALL LIABILITIES AND ASSETS RELATING
TO THE ASHLAND HERCULES PENSION PLAN, OTHER THAN LIABILITIES AND ASSETS RELATING TO ACTIVE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE COVERED BY THE HOPEWELL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN RETAINED BY ASHLAND. IN ADDITION, VALVOLINE WILL ASSUME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN ASHLAND EXCESS BENEFIT AND SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE PORTIONS OF THE ASHLAND NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS THAT RELATE TO VALVOLINES EMPLOYEES AND OUR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS.

FINAL SEPARATION WILL BE CONVERTED INTO VALVOLINE TIME-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, BASED ON PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED AS OF THE FINAL SEPARATION. ANY OUTSTANDING 2016-2018 LTIP PERFORMANCE UNITS AND ANY PERFORMANCE UNITS GRANTED FOLLOWING THE IPO THAT
ARE HELD BY VALVOLINES EMPLOYEES AT THE TIME OF THE FINAL SEPARATION WILL BE CONVERTED INTO VALVOLINE TIME-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS BASED ON PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE END OF THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
TERMS OF THE AWARD. OUTSTANDING 2014-2016 LTIP PERFORMANCE UNITS WILL VEST IN NOVEMBER 2016 AND WILL BE SETTLED IN ASHLAND COMMON STOCK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR TERMS. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS GRANTED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. WILL GENERALLY BE TREATED

ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2016, EAGLE MATERIALS INC. (THE COMPANY) AND CEMEX CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS ATLANTIC, LLC (THE SELLER)
ENTERED INTO AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY WILL ACQUIRE (THE ACQUISITION) (I) A CEMENT PLANT LOCATED IN FAIRBORN, OHIO (THE CEMENT PLANT), (II) A CEMENT
DISTRIBUTION TERMINAL LOCATED IN COLUMBUS, OHIO (THE DISTRIBUTION TERMINAL), AND (III) CERTAIN OTHER PROPERTIES AND ASSETS USED BY THE SELLER IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING (COLLECTIVELY, THE CEMEX TARGET BUSINESS). 
THE PURCHASE PRICE (THE PURCHASE PRICE) TO BE PAID BY THE COMPANY IN THE ACQUISITION IS $400 MILLION IN CASH, SUBJECT TO A
CUSTOMARY POST-CLOSING INVENTORY ADJUSTMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL ASSUME CERTAIN LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER RELATING TO THE CEMEX TARGET BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, RECLAMATION OBLIGATIONS AND VARIOUS
OTHER LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE CEMEX TARGET BUSINESS AFTER THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION (THE CLOSING). THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO FUND THE PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH ON HAND AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANYS EXISTING BANK CREDIT FACILITY. 
THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS, AS WELL AS INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SUBJECT TO
SPECIFIED LIMITATIONS. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER UNDER THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT COVERS BOTH BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES RETAINED BY THE SELLER. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY
COVERS BOTH BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BY THE COMPANY. IN THE CASE OF THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER WITH RESPECT TO BREACHES OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE
SELLER ARE SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO $4.0 MILLION AND A CAP ON LOSSES EQUAL TO $30.0 MILLION. SUCH DEDUCTIBLE AND CAP DO NOT APPLY TO RIGHTS TO INDEMNIFICATION BENEFITING EITHER PARTY IN RESPECT OF THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED BY THE
COMPANY OR RETAINED BY THE SELLER.  THE COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING (I) THE EXPIRATION OR
TERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE WAITING PERIOD UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1976, AS AMENDED, (II) THE DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED FOR THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION, INCLUDING TITLE POLICIES AND
SURVEYS, (III) THE RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTIES BEING TRUE AND CORRECT, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MATERIALITY EXCEPTIONS, AND (IV) THE PERFORMANCE BY THE PARTIES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT
IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY UNDER THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT ARE NOT CONDITIONED UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING FOR PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.
THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT CONTAINS CERTAIN TERMINATION RIGHTS THAT COULD BE EXERCISED BY THE COMPANY OR THE SELLER. EITHER PARTY MAY
TERMINATE THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT IF THE CLOSING HAS NOT OCCURRED BY FEBRUARY 15, 2017 IF THE CONDITIONS TO CLOSING HAVE NOT BEEN SATISFIED BY SUCH DATE, EXCEPT THAT A PARTY CANNOT TERMINATE THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT IF THE FAILURE OF THE
CLOSING TO OCCUR IS DUE TO THE FAILURE OF SUCH PARTY TO PERFORM ITS COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS AND CONDITIONS UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, EITHER PARTY MAY TERMINATE THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT IF THE OTHER PARTY BREACHES ANY
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND OTHER AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE OBLIGATIONS OF SUCH PARTY NOT TO BE SATISFIED AND SUCH BREACH IS NOT CURED BY FEBRUARY 15, 2017. 


SUBJECT TO SATISFACTION OF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND ASSUMING THE ASSET PURCHASE
AGREEMENT IS NOT TERMINATED, THE ACQUISITION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016 OR IN EARLY 2017.  THE ASSET PURCHASE
AGREEMENT WILL PROVIDE STOCKHOLDERS WITH INFORMATION REGARDING ITS TERMS, AND THE COMPANY INTENDS TO FILE THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT AS AN EXHIBIT TO THE COMPANYS NEXT FORM 10-Q. THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE ANY
OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CEMEX TARGET BUSINESS. THE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WERE MADE ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF THAT AGREEMENT AND AS OF THE DATES SPECIFIED THEREIN; WERE MADE
SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT; MAY BE SUBJECT TO QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES; AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO STANDARDS OF MATERIALITY APPLICABLE TO THE CONTRACTING PARTIES THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE THAT MAY
BE VIEWED AS MATERIAL TO INVESTORS. INVESTORS SHOULD NOT RELY ON THE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OR ANY DESCRIPTION THEREOF AS CHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE ACTUAL STATE OF FACTS OR CONDITION OF THE PARTIES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES. MOREOVER, INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS MAY CHANGE AFTER THE DATE OF THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WHICH SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION MAY OR MAY NOT BE FULLY

2013 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM AND AWARDS  AT ITS MEETING ON FEBRUARY 28, 2013, THE PERSONNEL AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE COMMITTEE) OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ALLEGHENY TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED (THE COMPANY)
TOOK SEVERAL ACTIONS CONCERNING BASE COMPENSATION FOR 2013 AND INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIODS BEGINNING IN 2013. 
CHANGES TO 2013 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM:  A. CEO COMPENSATION  REDUCTION IN INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES 
RICHARD J. HARSHMAN, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) RECOMMENDED, AND THE COMMITTEE APPROVED, THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS
TO MR. HARSHMANS COMPENSATION:   


 

 
 REDUCED HIS TARGET AWARD OPPORTUNITY UNDER THE PERFORMANCE/RESTRICTED STOCK PROGRAM (PRSP) FROM 170% TO 150% OF BASE SALARY. THE FORMER
CEOS TARGET AWARD OPPORTUNITY WAS AT 200% OF HIS BASE SALARY; AND   


 

 
 REDUCED HIS TARGET AWARD OPPORTUNITY UNDER THE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM (TSRP) FROM 170% TO 150% OF BASE
SALARY. THE FORMER CEOS TARGET AWARD OPPORTUNITY WAS AT 200% OF HIS BASE SALARY.  THE COMMITTEE WAS ADVISED BY ITS
COMPENSATION CONSULTANT THAT IF MR. HARSHMAN EARNED HIS TOTAL TARGET COMPENSATION, IT WOULD RANK BELOW THE MEDIAN OF THE COMPANYS PEER GROUP FOR BENCHMARKING PURPOSES.   CHANGE TO CHANGE-IN-CONTROL AGREEMENT  IN ADDITION, MR. HARSHMAN SUGGESTED, AND
THE COMMITTEE APPROVED, REMOVING THE EXCISE TAX REIMBURSEMENT, OR GROSS-UP PROVISION IN HIS CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT. THE LETTER AGREEMENT ADDRESSING THE REMOVAL OF SUCH PROVISION IS FILED AS AN EXHIBIT AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE
TO THIS FORM 8-K.  B. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS FOR ALL NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, INCLUDING THE CEO 
REDUCTION OF MAXIMUM AWARD OPPORTUNITIES UNDER THE COMPANYS KEY EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE PLAN (KEPP) 
THE COMMITTEE CHOSE TO CUT IN HALF THE POTENTIAL PAYMENT OPPORTUNITIES UNDER LEVEL I OF THE KEPP TO A MAXIMUM OF FIVE TIMES BASE SALARY, BUT THE INCOME
BEFORE TAX PERFORMANCE GRADIENTS REMAIN COMPARABLE TO THE PREVIOUS MAXIMUM GOALS. IN ADDITION, AT MR. HARSHMANS SUGGESTION, THE COMMITTEE DISCONTINUED LEVEL II OF THE KEPP FOR THE 2013-2015 PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. KEPP LEVEL II
HAD PROVIDED FOR POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIC OPERATIONAL GOALS, SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE DISCRETION. KEPP LEVEL I IS BASED SOLELY ON ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIED LEVELS OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES. 
  2 


INCREASE TO THRESHOLD FOR PAYOUT UNDER THE TSRP 
THE COMMITTEE INCREASED THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMPANY PERFORMANCE REQUIRED (TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN RELATIVE TO ITS PEER GROUP) FOR A
PAYOUT UNDER THE 2013-2015 TSRP TO THE 35TH PERCENTILE
FROM THE 25TH PERCENTILE. COMPANY PERFORMANCE BELOW THE
35TH PERCENTILE WOULD RESULT IN NO AWARD PAYMENT.
 CHANGE TO METHOD OF SETTING PERFORMANCE TARGETS UNDER THE COMPANYS ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN (AIP), PRSP AND KEPP
 THE COMMITTEE CHOSE TO SET TARGETS FOR THE 2013 AIP APPROXIMATELY AT THE ANALYSTS CONSENSUS EARNINGS ESTIMATES FOR COMPANY
EARNINGS PER SHARE. PRSP AND KEPP PERFORMANCE TARGETS WERE SET WITH REFERENCE TO PROJECTIONS OF THOSE EARNINGS ESTIMATES. PREVIOUSLY, SUCH TARGETS WERE SET WITH REFERENCE TO THE COMPANYS INTERNAL BUSINESS PLAN. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE
COMPANYS END MARKETS, THIS CHANGE WAS MADE SO THAT STOCKHOLDERS AND PROXY ADVISORY FIRMS COULD BETTER ASSESS THE DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY OF THE PROSPECTIVE GOALS.  DESCRIPTIONS OF SPECIFIC PLANS:  A. BASE SALARIES FOR 2013 
THE COMMITTEE INCREASED THE BASE SALARIES OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS BY APPROXIMATELY 3% TO THE AMOUNTS THAT FOLLOW, EFFECTIVE

 NO AIP AWARD WILL BE PAID TO INDIVIDUALS IF OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE ARE BELOW A SPECIFIED MINIMUM.
IN ADDITION, A PREREQUISITE TO ANY AWARD UNDER AIP, AS WELL AS UNDER THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS DISCUSSED BELOW, IS COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANYS CORPORATE GUIDELINES FOR BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS.

C. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS WITH PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIODS BEGINNING IN 2013 
AT ITS FEBRUARY 28, 2013 MEETING, THE COMMITTEE AWARDED SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PRSP SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS AND PERFORMANCE
FEATURES DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMMITTEE ALSO ESTABLISHED A PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD UNDER THE COMPANYS TSRP MEASURING THE COMPANYS TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2013 THROUGH AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31,
2015 AND DETERMINED AWARD OPPORTUNITY LEVELS FOR THAT PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED A PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2013 THROUGH AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2015 UNDER THE COMPANYS KEPP AND
SET PERFORMANCE GOALS AND AWARD OPPORTUNITIES UNDER THE KEPP. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AS PART OF THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM.  (1) PRSP  THE COMMITTEE DETERMINED THAT GRANTS OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PRSP IN
2013 PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE AND EMPLOYEE RETENTION AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTIONS AND PERFORMANCE FEATURES.  ONE HALF OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED TO AN INDIVIDUAL IS SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTIONS AND WOULD VEST, IF AT ALL, IF THE COMPANYS NET INCOME DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES EXCEEDED AN AGGREGATE OF $450 MILLION FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2013 THROUGH AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND THE PARTICIPANT WAS THEN AN EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY (EXCEPT FOR RETIREMENT, DEATH OR
DISABILITY). IF THAT LEVEL OF AGGREGATE NET INCOME IS NOT EXCEEDED FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2015, OR IF THE PARTICIPANT IS NO LONGER AN EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN RETIREMENT, DEATH OR DISABILITY,
BEFORE DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE SHARES OF STOCK SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTIONS WOULD BE FORFEITED.  THE OTHER ONE HALF OF THE
NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED TO AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD VEST ON THE EARLIER OF (I) DECEMBER 31, 2015, IF THE NET INCOME THRESHOLD DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED SHARES IS MET FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31,
2015, OR (II) MARCH 1, 2018, IF THE PARTICIPANT IS THEN AN EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY (EXCEPT FOR RETIREMENT, DEATH OR DISABILITY). 
DIVIDENDS DECLARED ON THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK WILL BE ACCUMULATED AND PAID IN STOCK TO HOLDERS OF PERFORMANCE/RESTRICTED STOCK WHEN AND TO THE
EXTENT THE RESTRICTIONS LAPSE ON THE SHARES. THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF SHARES OF PERFORMANCE/RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTED TO AN INDIVIDUAL IS DETERMINED BY DIVIDING A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF THE INDIVIDUALS BASE SALARY BY THE AVERAGE OF THE HIGH
AND LOW TRADING PRICES OF A SHARE OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE RESPECTIVE PERCENTAGE OF BASE SALARY USED TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF PERFORMANCE/RESTRICTED STOCK FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE
OFFICERS:

(2) TSRP  THE COMPANYS TSRP MEASURES THE COMPANYS RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (GENERALLY, THE CHANGE IN THE TRADING PRICE OF A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY PLUS DIVIDENDS PAID)
(TSR) FOR THE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD AGAINST THE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF A GROUP OF PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES DEEMED COMPARABLE BY THE COMMITTEE FOR THE SAME PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. A TARGET NUMBER OF SHARES,
DETERMINED BY DIVIDING A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF AN INDIVIDUALS BASE SALARY BY THE AVERAGE OF THE CLOSING PRICE OF A SHARE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK FOR THE THIRTY BUSINESS DAYS PRECEDING JANUARY 1, 2013, WILL BE DELIVERED IN
2016 TO TSRP PARTICIPANTS IF THE COMPANYS RELATIVE TSR IS AT THE 50TH PERCENTILE. ONE HALF OF THE TARGET NUMBER OF SHARES WILL BE DELIVERED IF THE LEVEL OF THE COMPANYS TSR PERFORMANCE IS AT THE 35TH PERCENTILE AND TWICE THE TARGET NUMBER IF THE LEVEL OF THE COMPANYS TSR PERFORMANCE IS AT THE 90TH PERCENTILE; INTERPOLATION BETWEEN POINTS IS MADE ON A STRAIGHT LINE
BASIS. NO AWARD IS PAID FOR PERFORMANCE BELOW THE 35TH
PERCENTILE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF BASE SALARY USED TO DETERMINE THE TARGET NUMBER OF SHARES FOR THE TSRP AWARD FOR THE 2013-2015 PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS:

 (3) KEPP 
THE COMPANYS KEPP IS A PERFORMANCE-BASED LONG-TERM CASH INCENTIVE PLAN IN WHICH THE EIGHT KEY INDIVIDUALS WHO COMPRISE THE COMPANYS
MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, INCLUDING THE FIVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PARTICIPATE. FOR THE 2013-2015 PLAN, ONLY LEVEL I OF THE KEPP WILL BE OPERATIVE. CASH AMOUNTS ARE PAID AT THE MULTIPLE OF BASE SALARY INDICATED, IF AT ALL AND ONLY TO THE
EXTENT THE SPECIFIED AGGREGATE INCOME BEFORE TAXES GOALS ARE REACHED, AND THOSE AMOUNTS OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES APPROXIMATE ESTIMATED AVERAGE ANNUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE 2013-2015 PERIOD AS INDICATED:

 FOR THE 2013-2015 KEPP, LEVEL II WAS DISCONTINUED.  KEPP LEVEL I PROVIDES THAT, IF THE ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT FOR ANY ONE YEAR IN A PARTICULAR KEPP PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD EQUALS OR EXCEEDS A PRO RATA TARGET GRADIENT, KEPP PARTICIPANTS EARN ONE THIRD OF
THE KEPP PAYMENT FOR THAT GRADIENT, WHICH AMOUNT IS PAID AFTER THE END OF THE KEPP PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. SUCH AMOUNTS EARNED BUT NOT YET PAID FOR PRIOR PERIODS ARE REPORTED IN THE PROXY STATEMENT COMPENSATION TABLES IN THE YEARS EARNED.

  6 


D. TARGET SETTING CONSIDERATIONS UNDER THE INCENTIVE PLANS 
IN PRIOR YEARS, THE COMMITTEE SET TARGET PERFORMANCE LEVELS FOR AIP AND FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIODS FOR PRSP AND KEPP IN LIGHT OF
THE BUSINESS CONDITIONS THEN PERCEIVED BY THE COMPANY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BUSINESS PLANS OF THE COMPANY SET AFTER A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FACED IN THE END MARKETS THE COMPANY SERVES. 
THE COMMITTEE CHOSE TO SET PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR THE 2013 AIP WITH REFERENCE TO THE MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED ANALYSTS CONSENSUS ESTIMATES FOR 2013
AND, FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIODS FOR PRSP AND KEPP, WITH REFERENCE TO PROJECTIONS BASED ON THE CONSENSUS OF ANALYSTS ESTIMATES. PRSP TARGETS ARE SLIGHTLY BELOW THE PROJECTIONS DUE TO THE RETENTION ASPECTS OF THIS
RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED PLAN. KEPP TARGETS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE PROJECTIONS AND REQUIRE TARGET EARNINGS FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD TO APPROXIMATE AN AVERAGE OF $1.95 PER YEAR, AT TARGET, OR A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE
OF 10% FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT THESE TARGETS ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE AND PROVIDE GREATER CHALLENGE THAN IN PAST YEARS.  THE COMMITTEE ACTED ON MR. HARSHMANS RECOMMENDATION TO REDUCE HIS RELATIVE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE PRSP AND TRSP. AS A PERCENTAGE OF BASE SALARY, THE CEO OPPORTUNITIES SET IN 2013 ARE
APPROXIMATELY 78% OF THE OPPORTUNITIES GRANTED TO HIS PREDECESSOR. THE COMMITTEE WAS ADVISED THAT, IF PERFORMANCE IS AT TARGET FOR EACH PLAN, MR. HARSHMANS TOTAL CASH AND EQUITY COMPENSATION (USING THE STOCK TRADING PRICE AT DATE OF
GRANT) WILL BE BELOW MEDIAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION FOR THE BENCHMARKING GROUP USED BY THE COMMITTEE FOR DETERMINING COMPENSATION. 
THE COMMITTEE REVISED THE COMPENSATION BENCHMARKING GROUP USED FOR SETTING 2013 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION BY ELIMINATING CERTAIN COMPANIES THAT ARE
SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER OR SUBSTANTIALLY SMALLER THAN THE COMPANY IN TERMS OF REVENUE, EVEN THOUGH SUCH COMPANIES COMPETE WITH THE COMPANY IN THE SAME END MARKETS. THE GROUP WAS THEN SUPPLEMENTED BY SIX MANUFACTURING COMPANIES THAT, SIMILAR TO THE
COMPANY, DO NOT SELL DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS AND ARE OF COMPARABLE SIZE.  THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT THE COMPENSATION FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE
OFFICERS IS WEIGHTED TO PERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENT IN EARNINGS AND TSR. APPROXIMATELY 84% OF MR. HARSHMANS CASH AND EQUITY COMPENSATION AT TARGET IS PERFORMANCE-BASED AND RELIANT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE EARNINGS GOALS AND TSR.

SPARTECHS BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER

SUB, AND MERGER LLC CONCERNING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF SPARTECH BY POLYONE THROUGH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES MERGER SUB AND MERGER LLC. THOSE ACTIONS, WEINREB V. SPARTECH, ET AL. AND WARREN V. SPARTECH, ET AL., HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL
PURPOSES AS IN RE SPARTECH CORPORATION SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION (THE MISSOURI STOCKHOLDER ACTION). THE MISSOURI STOCKHOLDER ACTION ALLEGES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE DIRECTORS OF SPARTECH HAVE BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES OWED TO
STOCKHOLDERS BY APPROVING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF SPARTECH BY POLYONE AND BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN INFORMATION TO STOCKHOLDERS. THE MISSOURI STOCKHOLDER ACTION FURTHER ALLEGES THAT POLYONE, MERGER SUB, AND MERGER LLC HAVE AIDED AND ABETTED
THE DIRECTORS OF SPARTECH IN BREACHING THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MISSOURI STOCKHOLDER ACTION SEEKS TO ENJOIN THE MERGER. 
TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE ALSO FILED IN DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT (THE DELAWARE STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS). ONE OF THE DELAWARE STOCKHOLDER
ACTIONS, GROSS V. SPARTECH ET AL., WAS FILED AGAINST SPARTECH, ITS DIRECTORS, POLYONE, MERGER SUB, AND MERGER LLC. THE OTHER DELAWARE STOCKHOLDER ACTION, PILL V. SPARTECH, ET AL., WAS FILED AGAINST SPARTECH AND ITS DIRECTORS. THE DELAWARE
STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS ALLEGED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE DIRECTORS OF SPARTECH HAVE BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES OWED TO STOCKHOLDERS BY APPROVING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF SPARTECH BY POLYONE AND BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN INFORMATION TO
STOCKHOLDERS. GROSS V. SPARTECH, ET AL. ALSO ALLEGED THAT POLYONE, MERGER SUB, AND MERGER LLC HAVE AIDED AND ABETTED THE DIRECTORS OF SPARTECH IN BREACHING THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DELAWARE STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS SOUGHT TO ENJOIN
THE MERGER. AFTER THEIR REQUEST TO STAY THE DELAWARE STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS WAS DENIED, PLAINTIFFS IN THE DELAWARE STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS FILED A NOTICE AND (PROPOSED) ORDER OF DISMISSAL ON JANUARY 31, 2013, WHICH WAS GRANTED WITH MODIFICATIONS ON
FEBRUARY 1, 2013.  A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION HAS ALSO BEEN FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI
AGAINST SPARTECH, ITS DIRECTORS, POLYONE, MERGER SUB, AND MERGER LLC. FAULKNER V. HOLT, ET AL. (THE MISSOURI DISTRICT COURT STOCKHOLDER ACTION), ALLEGES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE DIRECTORS OF SPARTECH HAVE BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY
DUTIES OWED TO STOCKHOLDERS BY APPROVING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF SPARTECH BY POLYONE AND BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN INFORMATION TO STOCKHOLDERS. THE MISSOURI DISTRICT COURT STOCKHOLDER ACTION FURTHER ALLEGES THAT POLYONE, MERGER SUB, AND
MERGER LLC HAVE AIDED AND ABETTED THE DIRECTORS OF SPARTECH IN BREACHING THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES. THE MISSOURI DISTRICT COURT STOCKHOLDER ACTION ALSO BRINGS A CLAIM, INDIVIDUALLY, AGAINST THE DIRECTORS OF SPARTECH UNDER SECTION 14(A) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND RULE 14A-9 PROMULGATED THEREUNDER. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MISSOURI DISTRICT COURT STOCKHOLDER ACTION SEEKS TO ENJOIN THE MERGER. 


POLYONE, MERGER SUB, MERGER LLC, SPARTECH, AND SPARTECHS DIRECTORS BELIEVE THE MISSOURI STOCKHOLDER
ACTION, THE DELAWARE STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS, AND THE MISSOURI DISTRICT COURT STOCKHOLDER ACTION AND THE UNDERLYING CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT.  ON
MARCH 5, 2013, COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES IN EACH OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED LAWSUITS ENTERED INTO THE MOU, IN WHICH THEY AGREED ON THE TERMS OF A SETTLEMENT OF THE MISSOURI STOCKHOLDER ACTION, INCLUDING THE DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE OF THE MISSOURI
STOCKHOLDER ACTION AND A RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS MADE THEREIN AGAINST ALL OF THE DEFENDANTS. THE MOU ALSO PROVIDES FOR DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE OF THE MISSOURI DISTRICT COURT STOCKHOLDER ACTION. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE EXECUTION OF AN APPROPRIATE STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT, CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER, AND FINAL APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT BY THE CIRCUIT COURT OF ST. LOUIS COUNTY, MISSOURI. IN ADDITION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT AND AS
PROVIDED IN THE MOU, THE PARTIES CONTEMPLATE THAT PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL WILL SEEK AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS FEES AND EXPENSES AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE MERGER WILL BE CONSUMMATED, THAT THE PARTIES ULTIMATELY
WILL ENTER INTO A STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT, OR THAT THE COURT WILL APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT EVEN IF THE PARTIES ENTER INTO SUCH STIPULATION. IF THE SETTLEMENT CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET, THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MOU WOULD BECOME

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES:  THE MERGER  BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER  THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSIDERATION OF OTHER FINANCIAL ADVISORS  THE LAST PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 44 OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS MAKES REFERENCE TO A PRELIMINARY MEETING AMONG THE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND BARCLAYS ON APRIL 26,
2012. THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE OF THE MEETING ON APRIL 26, 2012 WAS TO EVALUATE THE MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 44 OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS DID NOT CONSIDER ANY OTHER FINANCIAL ADVISOR
AT THAT TIME. THE LAST PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 46 OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS MAKES REFERENCE TO THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION OF AND REASONS IN SUPPORT OF ITS DECISION TO ENGAGE BARCLAYS AS ITS FINANCIAL ADVISOR ON JULY 27,
2012.  STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BY THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
THE SIXTH FULL PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 45 OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS MAKES REFERENCE TO THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS
DISCUSSIONS, DURING ITS JUNE 19 AND 20, 2012 MEETING, OF THE POLYONE PROPOSAL IN THE CONTEXT OF SPARTECHS OTHER STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES. AS PART OF THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF SPARTECHS ONGOING
EVALUATION OF SPARTECHS BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT REGULARLY CONSIDERED AND ADVISED THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, OR REFINANCINGS. THESE INCLUDED INCREMENTAL INVESTMENTS IN SPARTECHS BUSINESS SUCH
AS INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND ITS PRESENCE IN HIGHER MARGIN BUSINESSES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR DIVESTITURES OF NON-CORE OPERATIONS. THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSIDERED THE REASONABLY ATTAINABLE BENEFITS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS RELATED TO THE EXECUTION
OF THESE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, AND REFINANCINGS, AND DETERMINED THAT THEY WERE NOT, ALONE OR TOGETHER, A BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO THE POTENTIAL STRATEGIC TRANSACTION WITH POLYONE. 
THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSIDERATION OF CREATING A SPECIAL COMMITTEE 
DURING THE MEETING OF THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON AUGUST 23, 2012, AS REFERENCED ON PAGE 47 OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS,
THE DIRECTORS CONSIDERED CREATING A SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR SPARTECH. FOLLOWING THIS MEETING, THE MEMBERS OF THE SPARTECH BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONTINUED TO EVALUATE WHETHER TO
CREATE A SPECIAL COMMITTEE AND CAME TO A CONSENSUS THAT IT WAS BEST TO INCLUDE THE ENTIRE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN THESE DISCUSSIONS, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WERE INDEPENDENT AND THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
WITH POLYONE DID NOT CREATE CONFLICT ISSUES THAT REQUIRED THE FORMATION OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE. 


THE MERGER  POLYONES REASONS FOR THE MERGER 
THE SECOND BULLET POINT ON PAGE 53 OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS MAKES REFERENCE TO CERTAIN EXPECTED SYNERGIES TO BE DERIVED FROM THE
POTENTIAL TRANSACTION BETWEEN POLYONE AND SPARTECH. AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, POLYONE EXPECTS THAT NEAR-TERM SYNERGY OPPORTUNITIES WILL INVOLVE THE ELIMINATION OF REDUNDANT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND OVERHEAD COSTS. IMPLEMENTATION OF
POLYONES LEAN SIX SIGMA PROGRAM, ALIGNMENT OF MANUFACTURING ASSETS WITH THE VOICE OF THE CUSTOMER AND, ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE, IMPROVEMENTS TO SALES FORCE TRAINING, EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SYNERGISTIC
OPPORTUNITIES. COLLECTIVELY, THESE OPPORTUNITIES SUPPORT POLYONES PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF PRETAX ANNUALIZED SYNERGIES OF $65 MILLION IN OPERATING INCOME BY THE END OF YEAR THREE.

BE DELETED AND REPLACED WITH THE FOLLOWING:  IN THE FIRST DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS, OR THE DCF ANALYSIS (EBITDA
MULTIPLE), THE RESIDUAL VALUE OF SPARTECH AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD, OR TERMINAL VALUE, WAS ESTIMATED BY SELECTING A RANGE OF TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLES OF 5.25X TO 5.75X AND APPLYING SUCH RANGE TO THE ESTIMATED 2017 EBITDA OF $108
MILLION BASED ON THE MANAGEMENT PROJECTIONS, WHICH 



INCLUDED A BASE CASE, UPSIDE CASE AND DOWNSIDE CASE. THE DCF ANALYSIS (EBITDA MULTIPLE) EXCLUDED THE IMPACT OF ANY CONTINGENT OR SIMILAR LIABILITIES. IN THE SECOND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS,

CONDITIONS. IN THE CASE OF SPARTECH, BARCLAYS PERFORMED TWO LEVERAGED ACQUISITION ANALYSES. IN THE FIRST CASE, OR SPARTECH LBO ANALYSIS (CURRENT), BARCLAYS ASSUMED THE FOLLOWING IN ITS ANALYSIS: (I) TOTAL DEBT / LTM EBITDA MULTIPLE OF 4.5X FOR

SUCH RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WILL BE GRANTED AT THE EARLIEST UPON THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE CONFIRMS THAT THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE WAS ATTAINED, WILL VEST IN FIVE EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ANNUALLY BEGINNING ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, AND WILL CARRY WITH THEM THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ALL CASH DIVIDENDS PAID ON ONE SHARE OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY FOR EACH RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT WHILE SUCH RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT IS OUTSTANDING AND UNTIL SUCH RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT VESTS.

WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. (THE “COMPANY”) ANNOUNCED ON JUNE 21, 2013 A PLAN TO CONSOLIDATE ITS BERNZOMATIC HAND TORCH MANUFACTURING OPERATION IN MEDINA, NEW YORK INTO ITS EXISTING FACILITY IN CHILTON, WISCONSIN.  THE CONSOLIDATION IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE INTERNAL FREIGHT EXPENSE AND MAXIMIZE AVAILABLE CAPACITY AT THE CHILTON FACILITY WHERE THE COMPANY ALREADY MANUFACTURES BERNZOMATIC HAND TORCH FUEL CYLINDERS.  THE CLOSURE OF THE MEDINA OPERATION IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETE BY MID-2014 TO ENSURE AN ORDERLY TRANSITION.


THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE CONSOLIDATION AND CLOSURE OF THE MEDINA OPERATIONS WILL RESULT IN ONE-TIME RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IN THE RANGE OF $4.0 MILLION TO $5.0 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO SEVERANCE COSTS, COSTS TO RELOCATE AND INSTALL EQUIPMENT, EMPLOYEE RELATIONS AND TRAINING COSTS, AND MISCELLANEOUS START-UP COSTS.  MOST OF THESE COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS.  APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION OF THESE CHARGES RELATED TO EXPECTED SEVERANCE COSTS, ARE BEING ACCRUED IN THE COMPANY’S FOURTH QUARTER ENDED MAY 31, 2013.


THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 (THE “ACT”).  STATEMENTS BY THE COMPANY, RELATED TO EXPECTED COMPLETION OF THE CONSOLIDATION; SAVINGS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES; CAPACITY UTILIZATION; FUTURE EARNINGS; AND OTHER STATEMENTS WHICH ARE NOT HISTORICAL INFORMATION, CONSTITUTE ""FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS"" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ACT.

THE COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENT WAS APPROVED CONSISTENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND A PROPOSAL PREPARED BY TOWERS WATSON, SENSIENT'S INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT.

MANNING FOR SERVING AS NON-EMPLOYEE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND ADVISOR TO THE COMPANY.  THE COMPENSATION RECOMMENDED BY TOWERS WATSON TO BE PAID BY THE COMPANY TO KENNETH P. MANNING FOR SERVING AS NON-EMPLOYEE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND ADVISOR TO THE COMPANY WAS BASED ON A REVIEW OF COMPETITIVE PRACTICES WITH REGARD TO COMPENSATION LEVELS AND STRUCTURES FOR EMPLOYEE AND NON-EMPLOYEE CHAIRMAN ROLES AT OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES.

·


SOME OF THOSE DUTIES AND ADDITIONAL ADVISORY SERVICES ARE TYPICAL TO THE ROLE OF NON-EMPLOYEE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, AND OTHERS REFLECT KENNETH P.

STEEL DYNAMICS, INC. HAS ADOPTED A MAJORITY VOTING STANDARD APPLICABLE TO STOCKHOLDER VOTING IN UNCONTESTED DIRECTOR ELECTIONS.

AMENDED AND RESTATED 1997 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN; AND (D) MODIFY CERTAIN PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO OPTIONS AND SARS TO REFLECT THE REGISTRANT’S PRACTICES AND CURRENT STANDARD MARKET PRACTICES.

ADMINISTRATION
 
THE 1997 LTIP IS ADMINISTERED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.  THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO SELECT THE EMPLOYEES TO WHOM AWARDS ARE GRANTED, TO DETERMINE THE TYPE OF AWARDS GRANTED AND THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES COVERED BY SUCH AWARDS, TO SET THE TERMS, CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS OF SUCH AWARDS AND TO CANCEL OR SUSPEND AWARDS, IN EACH CASE IN A MANNER NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE 1997 LTIP.  THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IS AUTHORIZED TO INTERPRET THE 1997 LTIP AND TO ESTABLISH, AMEND AND RESCIND ANY RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE 1997 LTIP, TO DETERMINE THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH PARTICIPANTS IN THE 1997 LTIP, AND TO MAKE ALL OTHER DETERMINATIONS WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY OR ADVISABLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 1997 LTIP.  ANY DETERMINATION MADE BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IS FINAL AND CONCLUSIVE.
 
 


  


-3-





  


 
ELIGIBILITY
 
PRIOR TO THE SHAREHOLDERS’ APPROVAL OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT, ANY SALARIED EMPLOYEE OF THE REGISTRANT OR OF A 50%-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE REGISTRANT WAS ELIGIBLE TO BE SELECTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE TO RECEIVE AN AWARD UNDER THE 1997 LTIP.  FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY NOW GRANT AN AWARD UNDER THE 1997 LTIP TO ANY COMMON LAW EMPLOYEE OF THE REGISTRANT, A 50%-OWNED DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE REGISTRANT, OR ANY OTHER ENTITY IN WHICH THE REGISTRANT HAS A 20% OR GREATER DIRECT OR INDIRECT EQUITY INTEREST AND WHICH IS DESIGNATED AS A “SUBSIDIARY” BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE FOR PURPOSES OF THE 1997 LTIP.
 
TYPES OF AWARDS
 
UNDER THE 1997 LTIP, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY GRANT THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF AWARDS: (A) NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS (“NSOS”); (B) SARS, IN TANDEM WITH NSOS OR FREE-STANDING; (C) RESTRICTED COMMON SHARES (ALSO REFERRED TO AS “RESTRICTED STOCK”); (D) PERFORMANCE AWARDS (IN THE FORM OF PERFORMANCE SHARES OR PERFORMANCE UNITS) SUBJECT TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS DURING A SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE PERIOD; AND (E) OTHER AWARDS OF COMMON SHARES OR AWARDS VALUED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY REFERENCE TO, OR OTHERWISE BASED UPON, COMMON SHARES OR OTHER PROPERTY.  ALTHOUGH THE 1997 LTIP PERMITTED THE GRANTING OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS PRIOR TO AUGUST 7, 2007, NO INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS WERE GRANTED UNDER THE 1997 LTIP.
 
NSOS
 
THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY GRANT NSOS EITHER ALONE OR IN ADDITION TO OTHER AWARDS.  THE EXERCISE PRICE OF EACH NSO IS DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, BUT MAY NOT BE LESS THAN 100% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT OF THE NSO.  THE TERM OF EACH NSO IS FIXED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND, PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT, MAY NOT EXCEED TEN YEARS.  NSOS BECOME EXERCISABLE AT SUCH TIME OR TIMES AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND MAY BE EXERCISED BY PAYMENT IN FULL OF THE EXERCISE PRICE, EITHER IN CASH OR, AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN COMMON SHARES OR OTHER CONSIDERATION (INCLUDING, IF PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUTSTANDING AWARDS) HAVING A FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE THE NSO IS EXERCISED EQUAL TO THE EXERCISE PRICE.
 
SARS
 
THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY GRANT SARS WHICH ARE EITHER FREE-STANDING OR GRANTED IN TANDEM WITH NSOS (EITHER AT THE TIME OF OR AFTER THE GRANT OF THE RELATED NSO BUT PRIOR TO THE EXERCISE, TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF THE RELATED NSO).  NO SARS HAVE BEEN GRANTED UNDER THE 1997 LTIP TO DATE.  UPON EXERCISE OF AN SAR, THE HOLDER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE EXCESS OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES FOR WHICH THE SAR IS EXERCISED AS OF THE EXERCISE DATE OVER THE GRANT PRICE OF THE SAR.  THE GRANT PRICE (WHICH MAY NOT BE LESS THAN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES ON THE DATE OF GRANT) AND OTHER TERMS OF THE SAR WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.  THE SECOND AMENDMENT PROVIDES THAT THE TERM OF AN SAR MAY NOT EXCEED TEN YEARS.  PAYMENT BY THE COMPANY UPON THE EXERCISE OF AN SAR WILL BE MADE IN CASH, COMMON SHARES, OTHER PROPERTY OR ANY COMBINATION THEREOF, AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES.  ANY SAR RELATED TO AN NSO WILL TERMINATE AND NO LONGER BE EXERCISABLE UPON THE EXERCISE OR TERMINATION OF THE RELATED NSO AND ANY NSO RELATED TO AN SAR WILL TERMINATE AND NO LONGER BE EXERCISABLE UPON THE EXERCISE OR TERMINATION OF THE RELATED SAR.
 
 


  


-4-





  


 
RESTRICTED STOCK
 
THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY GRANT RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS EITHER ALONE OR IN ADDITION TO OTHER AWARDS.  RESTRICTED STOCK MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED BY THE RECIPIENT UNTIL THE RESTRICTIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE LAPSE.  UNLESS OTHERWISE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, RECIPIENTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE CONSIDERATION OTHER THAN THE RENDERING OF SERVICES OR THE PAYMENT OF ANY MINIMUM AMOUNT REQUIRED BY LAW.  EACH RECIPIENT OF A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD WILL HAVE ALL OF THE RIGHTS OF A SHAREHOLDER OF THE COMPANY, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO VOTE THE UNDERLYING COMMON SHARES AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE ANY CASH DIVIDENDS RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING COMMON SHARES, UNLESS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OTHERWISE DETERMINES.  IF A PARTICIPANT’S EMPLOYMENT TERMINATES DURING THE RESTRICTION PERIOD, THE PARTICIPANT WILL FORFEIT ALL RESTRICTED STOCK STILL SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION, UNLESS OTHERWISE AUTHORIZED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.
 
PERFORMANCE AWARDS
 
THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY GRANT PERFORMANCE AWARDS EITHER ALONE OR IN ADDITION TO OTHER AWARDS.  THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS SELECTED PRIMARILY MULTIPLE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIODS DURING WHICH PERFORMANCE GOALS DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ARE MEASURED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE EXTENT TO WHICH A PERFORMANCE AWARD HAS BEEN EARNED.  THE PERFORMANCE PERIODS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERFORMANCE AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE 1997 LTIP HAVE GENERALLY COVERED THREE FISCAL YEARS ALTHOUGH THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS ALSO PERIODICALLY SELECTED SIX-MONTH AND QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE PERIODS.  THE PERFORMANCE LEVELS TO BE ACHIEVED FOR EACH PERFORMANCE PERIOD AND THE AMOUNT OF THE PERFORMANCE AWARD TO BE DISTRIBUTED ARE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.  PERFORMANCE AWARDS MAY BE PAID IN CASH, COMMON SHARES OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES.  THE OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE AWARD AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE THAT UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, A PARTICIPANT’S PERFORMANCE AWARDS ARE FORFEITED.  HOWEVER, IF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT IS DUE TO DEATH, DISABILITY OR RETIREMENT, A PRO RATA PAYOUT WILL BE MADE FOR PERFORMANCE PERIODS ENDING WITHIN 24 MONTHS AFTER TERMINATION BASED ON THE NUMBER OF MONTHS OF EMPLOYMENT COMPLETED BY THE PARTICIPANT DURING THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF TERMINATION, PROVIDED THAT THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE GOALS ARE ACHIEVED.  NO PAYOUT IS TO BE MADE FOR PERFORMANCE PERIODS ENDING MORE THAN 24 MONTHS AFTER TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
 
OTHER STOCK UNIT AWARDS

SUCH PERFORMANCE GOALS MAY BE STATED IN ABSOLUTE TERMS OR RELATIVE TO COMPARISON ENTITIES, INDICES OR OTHER MEASURES TO BE ACHIEVED DURING A PERFORMANCE PERIOD AND MAY BE APPLIED SOLELY WITH REFERENCE TO THE REGISTRANT OR A SUBSIDIARY OF THE REGISTRANT (OR AN AFFILIATE, BUSINESS UNIT OR DIVISION OF THE REGISTRANT OR A SUBSIDIARY OF THE REGISTRANT) OR RELATIVELY BETWEEN THE REGISTRANT OR A SUBSIDIARY OF THE REGISTRANT (OR AN AFFILIATE, BUSINESS UNIT OR DIVISION OF THE REGISTRANT OR A SUBSIDIARY OF THE REGISTRANT) AND ONE OR MORE UNRELATED ENTITIES OR BUSINESS UNITS OR INDICES.

THE PERFORMANCE GOALS MUST BE SET BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY, AND OTHERWISE COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF, SECTION 162(M).
 
LIMITATIONS ON NUMBER AND AMOUNT OF AWARDS
 
UNDER THE 1997 LTIP, NO PARTICIPANT MAY BE GRANTED AWARDS IN ANY ONE CALENDAR YEAR WITH RESPECT TO MORE THAN 200,000 COMMON SHARES.

COMMON SHARES SUBJECT TO 1997 LTIP
 
SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE SECOND AMENDMENT INCREASED THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES ISSUABLE OVER THE LIFE OF THE 1997 LTIP FROM 4,500,000 COMMON SHARES TO 6,500,000 COMMON SHARES.
 
IF ANY COMMON SHARES SUBJECT TO ANY AWARD UNDER THE 1997 LTIP ARE FORFEITED, ANY AWARD TERMINATES OR EXPIRES UNEXERCISED OR ANY AWARD IS SETTLED FOR CASH OR OTHER PROPERTY OR EXCHANGED FOR OTHER AWARDS, THE COMMON SHARES SUBJECT TO SUCH AWARD WILL AGAIN BE AVAILABLE FOR GRANT PURSUANT TO THE 1997 LTIP.  THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS UNDER THE 1997 LTIP WILL ALSO BE INCREASED BY THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES WITHHELD BY OR TENDERED TO THE REGISTRANT IN CONNECTION WITH THE PAYMENT OF THE EXERCISE PRICE OF AN NSO UNDER THE 1997 LTIP.  THE SECOND AMENDMENT, HOWEVER, PROHIBITS COMMON SHARES WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF NSOS OR SARS GRANTED ON OR AFTER SEPTEMBER 26, 2013 FROM BEING AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE AWARDS UNDER THE 1997 LTIP, EVEN IF SUCH NSO OR SAR IS FORFEITED, TERMINATED, EXPIRES UNEXERCISED, SETTLED IN CASH OR PROPERTY OTHER THAN COMMON SHARES OR EXCHANGED FOR ANOTHER AWARD OR THE COMMON SHARES SUBJECT TO SUCH NSO OR SAR CAN OTHERWISE NO LONGER BE ISSUED.

THE COMMON SHARES DELIVERABLE UNDER THE 1997 LTIP MAY CONSIST IN WHOLE OR IN PART OF EITHER AUTHORIZED AND UNISSUED COMMON SHARES OR ISSUED COMMON SHARES WHICH HAVE BEEN REACQUIRED BY THE REGISTRANT.
 
IN THE EVENT OF ANY STOCK DIVIDEND, STOCK SPLIT, RECAPITALIZATION, REORGANIZATION, MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, SPIN-OFF, REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, EXCHANGE OF SHARES OR SIMILAR TRANSACTION, OR OTHER CHANGE IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE OR CAPITALIZATION AFFECTING THE COMMON SHARES OR THE PRICE THEREOF, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WILL MAKE SUCH SUBSTITUTION OR ADJUSTMENT IN THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OR CLASS OF SHARES WHICH MAY BE DELIVERED UNDER THE 1997 LTIP, IN THE AGGREGATE OR TO ANY ONE PARTICIPANT, AND IN THE NUMBER, CLASS AND OPTION PRICE OR EXERCISE PRICE OF SHARES SUBJECT TO THE OUTSTANDING AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE 1997 LTIP (INCLUDING THE SUBSTITUTION OF SIMILAR OPTIONS TO PURCHASE THE SHARES OF, OR OTHER AWARDS DENOMINATED IN THE SHARES OF, ANOTHER COMPANY) AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DEEMS TO BE APPROPRIATE TO MAINTAIN THE PURPOSE OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT.  ANY SUCH ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE.
 
THE SECOND AMENDMENT PROHIBITS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, WITHOUT OBTAINING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AND EXCEPT FOR THE ADJUSTMENTS MADE AS DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, FROM (I) AMENDING THE TERMS OF AN OUTSTANDING AWARD TO REDUCE THE OPTION PRICE OF AN OUTSTANDING NSO OR THE GRANT PRICE OF AN OUTSTANDING SAR; (II) CANCELLING AN OUTSTANDING NSO OR SAR IN EXCHANGE FOR NSOS OR SARS WITH AN OPTION PRICE OR GRANT PRICE, AS APPLICABLE, THAT IS LESS THAN THE OPTION PRICE OR GRANT PRICE OF THE ORIGINAL NSO OR SAR; (III) CANCELLING AN OUTSTANDING NSO OR SAR WITH AN OPTION PRICE OR GRANT PRICE, AS APPLICABLE, WHICH IS ABOVE THE CURRENT FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES UNDERLYING THE NSO OR SAR IN EXCHANGE FOR ANOTHER AWARD, CASH OR OTHER SECURITIES; (IV) TAKING ANY OTHER ACTION THAT IS TREATED AS A “REPRICING” UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; OR (V) TAKING ANY OTHER ACTION THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF “REPRICING” AN AWARD, AS DEFINED UNDER THE APPLICABLE RULES OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.
 
THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN PERFORMANCE AWARD GOALS OR IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OTHER AWARDS IN RECOGNITION OF UNUSUAL OR NON-RECURRING EVENTS AFFECTING THE REGISTRANT OR ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS OR ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  HOWEVER, WITH RESPECT TO ANY AWARD SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE GOALS INTENDED TO COMPLY WITH SECTION 162(M), THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY NOT ADJUST UPWARDS THE AMOUNT PAYABLE UNDER THE AWARD, NOR MAY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WAIVE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE GOALS EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THE DEATH OR DISABILITY OF THE PARTICIPANT.
 
NONASSIGNABILITY OF AWARDS
 
UNLESS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES OTHERWISE AT THE TIME AN AWARD IS GRANTED, NO AWARD GRANTED UNDER THE 1997 LTIP MAY BE SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE ENCUMBERED BY A PARTICIPANT, OTHERWISE THAN BY WILL, BY DESIGNATION OF A BENEFICIARY TO EXERCISE THE PARTICIPANT’S RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE AWARD AFTER THE PARTICIPANT’S DEATH, OR BY THE LAWS OF DESCENT AND DISTRIBUTION.

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
 
THE BOARD MAY AMEND, ALTER OR DISCONTINUE THE 1997 LTIP, PROVIDED THAT NO SUCH ACTION MAY IMPAIR THE RIGHTS OF A PARTICIPANT UNDER AN OUTSTANDING AWARD WITHOUT THE PARTICIPANT’S CONSENT.  IN ADDITION, WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL, NO AMENDMENT MAY BE MADE WHICH WOULD (I) INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES RESERVED FOR DELIVERY UNDER THE 1997 LTIP, (II) CHANGE THE EMPLOYEES OR CLASS OF EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 1997 LTIP, OR (III) OTHERWISE REQUIRE SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL UNDER APPLICABLE LAW OR TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY SECTION 162(M) OR THE RULES OF ANY SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES ARE LISTED OR TRADED.
 
CHANGE IN CONTROL
 
TO MAINTAIN ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS’ RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A “CHANGE IN CONTROL” OF THE REGISTRANT, UNLESS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES OTHERWISE AT THE TIME OF GRANT WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR AWARD:
 




●  


ANY NSOS AND SARS OUTSTANDING AS OF THE DATE THE CHANGE IN CONTROL IS DETERMINED TO HAVE OCCURRED, AND WHICH ARE NOT THEN EXERCISABLE AND VESTED, WILL BECOME FULLY EXERCISABLE AND VESTED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT; HOWEVER, IF AN SAR IS HELD BY A PARTICIPANT WHO IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 16(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (A “SECTION 16(B) PARTICIPANT”), THE SAR WILL NOT BECOME FULLY VESTED AND EXERCISABLE UNLESS THE SAR HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS;



 




●  


THE RESTRICTIONS APPLICABLE TO ANY RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD WILL LAPSE, AND THE UNDERLYING COMMON SHARES WILL BECOME FREE OF ALL RESTRICTIONS AND BECOME FULLY VESTED AND TRANSFERABLE TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT;



 




●  


ALL PERFORMANCE AWARDS WILL BE CONSIDERED TO BE EARNED AND PAYABLE IN FULL, AND ANY OTHER RESTRICTION WILL LAPSE AND THE PERFORMANCE AWARDS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY SETTLED OR DISTRIBUTED; AND

THE RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO ANY OTHER STOCK UNIT AWARDS OR ANY OTHER AWARDS WILL LAPSE, AND THE OTHER STOCK UNIT AWARDS OR OTHER AWARDS WILL BECOME FREE OF ALL RESTRICTIONS OR CONDITIONS AND BECOME FULLY VESTED AND TRANSFERABLE TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT.



 
HOWEVER, FOR NSOS, RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS GRANTED IN FISCAL 2012 AND LATER, A DOUBLE TRIGGER PROVISION HAS BEEN ADDED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND THE CHANGE IN CONTROL MUST BE FOLLOWED BY AN ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT FOR THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS TO APPLY.
 
IN ADDITION, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY ALLOW PARTICIPANTS HOLDING NSOS TO ELECT, DURING THE 60-DAY PERIOD FOLLOWING THE CHANGE IN CONTROL, TO SURRENDER THE NSOS (OR ANY PORTION THEREOF) WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN EXERCISED IN EXCHANGE FOR A CASH PAYMENT EQUAL TO THE CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE PER SHARE (AS DEFINED IN THE 1997 LTIP) OVER THE EXERCISE PRICE PER SHARE.

CARPENTER TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (THE COMPANY) ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT IT WILL CHANGE ITS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, BEGINNING WITH ITS FISCAL YEAR 2014 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS.  THE CHANGE REFLECTS THE COMPLETION OF THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESSES ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY IN THE ACQUISITION OF LATROBE SPECIALTY METALS, INC. (LATROBE) IN FEBRUARY 2012.  PRIOR TO THIS CHANGE, THE LATROBE BUSINESSES WERE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE SEGMENT TO PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH THE FOCUS AND VISIBILITY INTO THE BUSINESS OF THE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS. THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED LATROBE SEGMENT ALSO INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS IN MEXICO.  SINCE THE LATROBE BUSINESSES ARE NOW FULLY INTEGRATED, THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED LATROBE SEGMENT HAS BEEN MERGED INTO THE COMPANYS OPERATING MODEL, IN WHICH THE COMPANYS INTEGRATED STEEL MILL OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED DISTINCTLY FROM THE COLLECTION OF OTHER DIFFERENTIATED OPERATIONS. BEGINNING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2014, THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, SPECIALTY ALLOYS OPERATIONS (SAO) AND PERFORMANCE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS (PEP).
 
THE SAO SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR PREMIUM ALLOY AND STAINLESS STEEL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. THIS INCLUDES OPERATIONS PERFORMED AT MILLS PRIMARILY IN READING AND LATROBE AND SURROUNDING AREAS IN PENNSYLVANIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND THE NEW PREMIUM PRODUCTS MANUFACTURING FACILITY BEING BUILT IN LIMESTONE COUNTY, ALABAMA. THE COMBINED ASSETS OF THE SAO OPERATIONS ARE BEING MANAGED IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER TO OPTIMIZE EFFICIENCY AND PROFITABILITY ACROSS THE TOTAL SYSTEM.
 
THE PEP SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF THE COMPANYS DIFFERENTIATED OPERATIONS. THIS SEGMENT INCLUDES THE DYNAMET TITANIUM BUSINESS, THE CARPENTER POWDER PRODUCTS BUSINESS, THE AMEGA WEST BUSINESS, THE SPECIALTY STEEL SUPPLY BUSINESS AND THE LATROBE AND MEXICO DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES. THE BUSINESSES IN THE PEP SEGMENT ARE MANAGED WITH AN ENTREPRENEURIAL STRUCTURE TO PROMOTE SPEED AND FLEXIBILITY, AND DRIVE OVERALL REVENUE AND PROFIT GROWTH.
 
THE RECAST HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EXHIBITS 99.1 AND 99.2 TO THIS FORM 8-K DOES NOT REPRESENT A RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND HAS NO IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

NET SALES EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUES
 
THIS REPORT INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS OF NET SALES AS ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF RAW MATERIAL SURCHARGES, WHICH REPRESENTS A FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. WE PRESENT AND DISCUSS THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES REMOVING THE IMPACT OF RAW MATERIAL SURCHARGES FROM NET SALES PROVIDES A MORE CONSISTENT BASIS FOR COMPARING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.

DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.



 
ON OCTOBER 21, 2013, SENSIENT TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION (""SENSIENT"" OR THE ""COMPANY"") ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE TO ANNOUNCE THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED CHANGES TO THE COMPANY’S ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN AND LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN FOR ELECTED OFFICERS.  THE CHANGES, WHICH ARE IN RESPONSE TO SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK, ARE INTENDED TO CREATE AN ENHANCED LINKAGE OF EXECUTIVE PAY AND COMPANY PERFORMANCE.  THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K.
 
ADOPTION OF FORM OF PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT
 
ON OCTOBER 17, 2013, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED NEW PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AWARDS AND ADOPTED A FORM OF PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (THE ""AGREEMENT"") TO BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH FUTURE AWARDS OF NEW PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS PURSUANT TO, AND SUBJECT TO, THE COMPANY’S 2007 STOCK PLAN (THE ""PLAN"").



EACH PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT IN THE FORM OF THE AGREEMENT WILL SET FORTH THE GRANTEE'S NAME AND ADDRESS, THE GRANT DATE, THE THREE-YEAR RESTRICTED PERIOD AND THE TARGET NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS AS OF THE DATE OF THE UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AWARD.  AT THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR RESTRICTED PERIOD, THE PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS WILL VEST AND THE GRANTEE WILL BE ISSUED ONE SHARE OF COMMON STOCK FOR EACH VESTED PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT.  AT THE END OF THE TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE COMPENSATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE ""COMMITTEE"") WILL DETERMINE THE PERCENTAGE OF THE PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS THAT WILL BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR VESTING BASED ON THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY RELATIVE TO PRE-ESTABLISHED GOALS USING A PERFORMANCE MATRIX TO BE ATTACHED TO THE AGREEMENT AS EXHIBIT 1 AND GENERALLY DESCRIBED BELOW, SUBJECT TO FINALIZATION OF SPECIFIC TARGETS.
 
FOR THE DECEMBER 2013 GRANT, THE PERCENTAGE OF THE PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS THAT WILL BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR VESTING WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE OVER A TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD COMPARED TO THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF TWO PERFORMANCE METRICS – EBIT GROWTH (70% WEIGHT) AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (30% WEIGHT).
 

ANY EXECUTIVE OFFICER THAT HAS REACHED NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE, RECEIVED PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AWARDS AND WORKED FOR THE COMPANY DURING ANY PART OF THE TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD BEFORE VOLUNTARILY TERMINATING HIS OR HER EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY WILL BECOME VESTED IN THE FULL AWARD DETERMINED PURSUANT TO THE FORMULA UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THE TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. THE COMMITTEE, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, MAY VEST SOME OR ALL OF THE PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS ELIGIBLE FOR VESTING TO ANY EXECUTIVE OFFICER THAT VOLUNTARILY TERMINATES HIS OR HER EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY BECAUSE OF EARLY RETIREMENT AFTER THE TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD BUT BEFORE THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR RESTRICTED PERIOD. ANY EXECUTIVE OFFICER WHOSE EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY TERMINATES BECAUSE OF DEATH OR DISABILITY AFTER THE TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD BUT PRIOR TO THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR RESTRICTED PERIOD WILL BECOME VESTED IN THE FULL AWARD DETERMINED PURSUANT TO THE FORMULA MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF FULL MONTHS ELAPSED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE RESTRICTED PERIOD DIVIDED BY THIRTY-SIX, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE COMMITTEE, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, MAY VEST SOME OR ALL OF THE REMAINING PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS ELIGIBLE FOR VESTING. UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL DURING THE TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE COMPANY WILL ISSUE ONE SHARE OF STOCK PER PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT THAT COULD BECOME VESTED ASSUMING PERFORMANCE AT 100% OF TARGET LEVELS. UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL AFTER THE TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD BUT DURING THE THIRD YEAR OF THE RESTRICTED PERIOD, THE COMPANY WILL ISSUE ONE SHARE OF STOCK PER PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT THAT IS ELIGIBLE TO BECOME VESTED BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL PERFORMANCE DURING THE TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD.
 
THE FORM OF AGREEMENT IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 10.1 AND INCORPORATED IN THIS ITEM 5.02 BY REFERENCE; THIS SUMMARY DESCRIPTION IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FORM OF AGREEMENT.
 
SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS TO ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN
 
ON OCTOBER 17, 2013, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALSO APPROVED SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS TO THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN TO REBALANCE PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED TO CALCULATE ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS AND TO CLARIFY CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.  BEGINNING IN 2014, THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS WILL BE DETERMINED AND PAID BASED ON A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE COMPANY'S ACHIEVEMENT OF THREE PERFORMANCE GOALS – EARNINGS PER SHARE (50% WEIGHT), GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE (30% WEIGHT) AND CASH FLOW (20% WEIGHT).  THE ANNUAL BONUSES WILL BE SUBJECT TO A TARGET LEVEL FOR EACH OF THE THREE PERFORMANCE GOALS, WITH BONUSES FOR THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE RANGE OF 50% TO 85% OF ANNUAL BASE SALARY (DEPENDING ON THE OFFICER’S POSITION IN THE COMPANY) PAID IF THE TARGET LEVELS ARE ACHIEVED WITH RESPECT TO EACH PERFORMANCE GOAL. PERFORMANCE IN EXCESS OF THE TARGETED LEVELS ALLOWS FOR AN INCREASED AWARD, BUT AWARDS ARE CAPPED AT 200% OF THE BONUS AT THE TARGETED LEVELS. PERFORMANCE BELOW THE TARGETED LEVELS CAN RESULT IN A REDUCED AWARD, OR NO AWARD AT ALL IF NONE OF THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD LEVELS ARE ACHIEVED. FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE STANDPOINT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS SPECIFIED IN MORE DETAIL THE PLAN PERFORMANCE GOALS, CLARIFIED THE PLAN LANGUAGE ON THE TREATMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS AND SET RULES FOR PAYMENT OF BONUSES FOR PARTIAL YEAR PLAN PARTICIPANTS.
 
FOR ANY INCENTIVE AWARD THAT MAY BE EARNED IN 2013, THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY RELIANCE WAS ON EARNINGS PER SHARE WITH SUPPLEMENTAL TARGETS BASED ON IMPROVEMENTS IN REVENUE, CASH FLOW, RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL, EXPENSE LEVELS AND GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, SUBJECT TO AN OVERALL MAXIMUM OF 200% ON THE AGGREGATE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDED.



APPROVAL BY SHAREHOLDERS OF MATERIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN IS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (“SECTION 162(M)”), IF COMPENSATION PAYABLE PURSUANT TO THE INCENTIVE PLAN IS TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS “PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION” NOT SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATION ON DEDUCTIBILITY FOR TAX PURPOSES OF COMPENSATION IN EXCESS OF $1 MILLION PAID TO CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN ANY TAXABLE YEAR (THESE AFFECTED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE REFERRED TO AS “COVERED EMPLOYEES”).  THESE RULES ALSO REQUIRE THAT PLANS, LIKE THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN, BE APPROVED BY THE SHAREHOLDERS AT LEAST EVERY FIVE YEARS.  BECAUSE THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN WAS LAST APPROVED BY THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS AT THE 2009 ANNUAL MEETING, THE ENTIRE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AT THE 2014 ANNUAL MEETING.

GREIF FUNDING IS A DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF GREIF PACKAGING AND IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE GREIF
FUNDING IS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT LEGAL ENTITY FROM THE COMPANY, THE ASSETS OF GREIF FUNDING ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY, GREIF PACKAGING OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY, AND THE LIABILITIES OF

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE BOISE 2013 AUDIT). THE DECISION TO ENGAGE KPMG LLP AS DESCRIBED ABOVE WAS APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF PCAS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION RELATES TO THE PROXY STATEMENT (THE PROXY STATEMENT) OF ROYAL GOLD, INC. (THE COMPANY), DATED OCTOBER 11, 2013, FURNISHED TO STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOLICITATION OF PROXIES FOR THE COMPANYS 2013 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS.
 
SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE REGARDING PERFORMANCE MEASURES
 
AS DISCLOSED IN THE PROXY STATEMENT, THE COMPANY GRANTS PERFORMANCE SHARES UNDER ITS 2004 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN. PERFORMANCE SHARES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TO OBTAIN LONG-TERM, NON-DILUTIVE GROWTH PERFORMANCE. PERFORMANCE SHARES CAN ONLY BE EARNED IF A MULTI-YEAR PERFORMANCE GOAL IS MET WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF THE DATE OF GRANT. IF THE PERFORMANCE GOAL IS NOT EARNED BY THE END OF THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD, THE PERFORMANCE SHARES ARE FORFEITED.
 
PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING WITH 2012 MAY VEST UPON ROYAL GOLD MEETING A PRE-DEFINED PERFORMANCE GOAL RELATING TO GROWTH IN ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PER SHARE. THE PERFORMANCE GOAL IS CALCULATED BASED UPON A TEN PERCENT COMPOUNDED ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IN ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PER SHARE OVER THE TERM OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES. ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW, ON A PER SHARE BASIS, IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STRENGTH. THE COMPANY DEFINES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, AS OPERATING INCOME PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH CHARGES AND ANY IMPAIRMENT OF MINING ASSETS, LESS NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OPERATING INCOME OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES. PERFORMANCE SHARES MAY VEST IN 25% INCREMENTS UPON MEETING 25%, 50%, 75% AND 100% OF THE PERFORMANCE GOAL. PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL VEST UPON THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPENSATION, NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE (THE CNG COMMITTEE) OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT SUCH 25% INCREMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE GOAL HAS BEEN MET.
 
THE CNG COMMITTEE INTRODUCED A PERFORMANCE-BASED VESTING REQUIREMENT FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS GRANTED TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS BEGINNING WITH FISCAL YEAR 2013. IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT MEET A MINIMUM FINANCIAL MEASURE (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND OTHER NON-CASH CHARGES, OR ADJUSTED EBITDA, OF AT LEAST $175 MILLION) ESTABLISHED FOR FISCAL 2013, ALL OF THE SHARES OF STOCK UNDERLYING THE RESTRICTED STOCK GRANT WOULD BE FORFEITED. ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS $260.8 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2013, A RECORD FOR THE COMPANY, AND THE CNG COMMITTEE DETERMINED THAT THE MINIMUM FINANCIAL MEASURE FOR FISCAL 2013 WAS ACHIEVED.
 
THE COMPANYS ANNUAL CASH BONUS AWARDS ARE SIMILARLY CONDITIONED ON THE COMPANY MEETING A MINIMUM FINANCIAL MEASURE. IF THE COMPANY ACHIEVES ITS PREDETERMINED THRESHOLD CORPORATE PERFORMANCE MEASURE (ALSO ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $175 MILLION), ANNUAL BONUSES ARE RECOMMENDED TO THE CNG COMMITTEE BY THE COMPANYS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER BASED ON ANNUAL REVIEWS OF EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PERFORMANCE AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMPANYS CORPORATE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES.  IN DETERMINING CASH BONUSES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013, THE CNG COMMITTEE DETERMINED THAT THE THRESHOLD CORPORATE PERFORMANCE MEASURE WAS ACHIEVED.

RE:         ROYAL GOLD, INC. ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  NOVEMBER 20, 2013
PROPOSAL 3, ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (SAY ON PAY)
 
DEAR STOCKHOLDER:
 
BY NOW YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED ROYAL GOLD, INC.S NOTICE OF THE 2013 ANNUAL MEETING AND PROXY STATEMENT.  YOU CAN ALSO VIEW OUR PROXY STATEMENT AT WWW.ROYALGOLD.COM.
 
WE WRITE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AT THE ANNUAL MEETING BY VOTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON ALL PROPOSALS, INCLUDING PROPOSAL 3, ADVISORY VOTE ON COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (SAY ON PAY).
 
INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES (ISS) RECOMMENDED A VOTE AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL.  WHILE ISS HAS INDICATED TO US THAT IT MAY REVISE ITS OCTOBER 31, 2013 PROXY REPORT, WE ARE COMPELLED TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG DISAGREEMENT WITH ITS RECOMMENDATION.  IN ITS REPORT, ISS BASED ITS RECOMMENDATION LARGELY ON THE SIZE OF OUR CEOS EQUITY AWARDS MEASURED AGAINST A GROUP OF COMPARATOR COMPANIES DETERMINED BY ISS.
 
·      WE FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH THE PEER GROUP SELECTED BY ISS TO BENCHMARK OUR CEO COMPENSATION AND BELIEVE THAT IT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE OUR UNIQUE ROYALTY-BASED, PRECIOUS METALS BUSINESS MODEL.  IT ALSO FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THAT ROYAL GOLD IS ONE OF THE 20 LARGEST PRECIOUS METALS COMPANIES IN THE WORLD BY MARKET CAPITALIZATION.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT ISS INTERNAL POLICY REQUIRES IT TO TAKE A STANDARDIZED APPROACH THAT IDENTIFIES COMPARATOR COMPANIES BASED ON COMPANIES IN THE MSCI METALS AND MINING SECTOR AND BASED ON MAGNITUDE OF REVENUES, IGNORING MARKET CAPITALIZATION.  NONE OF THE 15 COMPANIES SELECTED BY ISS ARE IN THE PRECIOUS METALS ROYALTY BUSINESS, AND ONLY FOUR OF THE 15 COMPANIES SELECTED BY ISS ARE IN THE PRECIOUS METALS MINING BUSINESS.
 
·      IF THIS WAS NOT MISLEADING ENOUGH, ISS FAILED TO USE COMPARABLE TRAILING 12-MONTH PERIOD RESULTS FOR ITS SELECTED PEER COMPANIES, WHICH, GIVEN THE DECLINE IN GOLD AND SILVER PRICES IN THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF 2013, COMPLETELY DISTORTED THE COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS BETWEEN THE ISS-SELECTED PEER GROUP AND ROYAL GOLD WITH ITS JUNE 30 FISCAL YEAR-END.
 
·      THE ISS METHODOLOGIES COMPARE APPLES TO ORANGES AND IN OUR OPINION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY FLAWED AND INVALID.
 
ISS MEASUREMENT PERIODS ARE INCONSISTENT.
 
THE SUMMARY FINANCIALS FOR ROYAL GOLD IN THE ISS REPORT PRESENT RESULTS ON OUR FISCAL YEAR BASIS (JULY 1 TO JUNE 30) WHILE REPRESENTING THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE ISS PEER COMPANIES FOR OTHER ANNUAL PERIODS, MOSTLY CALENDAR YEAR END.
 
2





 
·      THE MISMATCH IN MEASUREMENT PERIOD RESULTS IN A VERY MISLEADING COMPARISON TO ROYAL GOLD.  EVERYONE WHO FOLLOWS THE INDUSTRY KNOWS THAT GOLD AND SILVER PRICES DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2012.  THE DECLINE IN GOLD AND SILVER PRICES AMOUNTED TO 29.6% AND 38.9%, RESPECTIVELY, FROM JANUARY 2, 2013 TO JUNE 28, 2013 (TRADING DAYS).  CORRESPONDINGLY, PRECIOUS METAL EQUITIES AS MEASURED BY THE PHILADELPHIA GOLD AND SILVER INDEX (XAU) DECLINED 46.5% DURING THE SAME PERIOD.  THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE LACK OF PRECISION IN ISS ANALYTICAL APPROACH.
 
·      WE CORRECTED THIS MISMATCH OF FINANCIAL REPORTING PERIODS FOR THE FIVE COMPANIES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE ISS REPORT. THE ROWS IN THE TABLE BELOW SHOW:  (I) THE ISS TSR CALCULATIONS USING DIFFERENT TWELVE MONTH MEASUREMENT PERIODS; (II) OUR CALCULATION OF TSR USING CONSISTENT TRAILING TWELVE MONTH PERIODS ENDING JUNE 30, 2013; AND (III) OUR CALCULATION OF TSR USING CONSISTENT TRAILING TWELVE MONTH PERIODS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2012.  CLEARLY, ROYAL GOLD PERFORMED MUCH BETTER THAN SUGGESTED IN THE ISS REPORT ON A RELATIVE BASIS.

ISS EXCLUDES RELEVANT COMPANIES FROM ISS PEER GROUP.
 
THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT TEN PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES WORLDWIDE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE PRECIOUS METAL ROYALTY BUSINESS.  ALL OF THEM MAINTAIN PRIMARY LISTINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES EXCEPT FOR ROYAL GOLD.  THIS MEANS THAT ALL OF THE COMPANIES MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO ROYAL GOLD ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE UNITED STATES INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION USED BY ISS.  ISS SELECTED NUMEROUS BROADER MATERIALS INDUSTRY COMPANIES FOR ITS PEER GROUP, IN ADDITION TO FOUR UNITED STATES PRECIOUS METALS MINING COMPANIES WITH FAR SMALLER MARKET VALUES THAN ROYAL GOLD.
 
·      GOLD IS OFTEN NEGATIVELY CORRELATED TO THE BROADER ECONOMY, SO BENCHMARKING ROYAL GOLDS TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN AGAINST CHEMICAL, CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, BASE METALS AND FOREST PRODUCTS COMPANIES IS SIMPLY NOT RELEVANT IN DETERMINING RELATIVE PERFORMANCE.
 
·      TO DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS POINT, ROYAL GOLDS SHARE PRICE HAS A 95.8% CORRELATION TO THE PRICE OF GOLD.  THE CHART BELOW ILLUSTRATES THAT THE BULK OF THE ISS PEER GROUP HAS NO OR SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE CORRELATION TO THE PRICE OF GOLD.

CORRELATION OF ISS PEER COMPANIES TO  LME GOLD PRICE JULY 1, 2012-JUNE 30, 2013
 

 
·      ROYAL GOLD THOUGHTFULLY CONSTRUCTED AND DISCLOSED ITS PEER GROUP ON PAGE 28 OF THE PROXY STATEMENT.  THE GROUP WE SELECTED INCLUDES OUR DIRECT ROYALTY COMPETITORS AND PRECIOUS METAL MINING COMPANIES OF SIMILAR RELATIVE SIZE AS MEASURED BY MARKET CAPITALIZATION.  THIS GROUP CONSISTS OF 13 PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES INCLUDING IAMGOLD, SILVER WHEATON, FRANCO-NEVADA, PAN AMERICAN SILVER, COEUR MINING, HECLA MINING, OSISKO MINING, CENTERRA GOLD, NEW GOLD, ALAMOS GOLD, AURICO GOLD, ELDORADO GOLD AND AGNICO EAGLE.
 
·      WE NOTE THAT ISS DOES NOT DISPLAY A COMPLETE LISTING OF OUR BENCHMARK COMPANIES IN ITS REPORT.  MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE NOT LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES.  HOWEVER, GOLD MINING IS AN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, AND THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT DOMICILE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PRECIOUS METALS COMPANIES TO MAKE PEER GROUP SELECTION STATISTICALLY VALID.  FURTHERMORE, THIS IS THE INTERNATIONAL PEER GROUP WITH WHOM WE COMPETE FOR EXECUTIVE TALENT AND IS THEREFORE THE RELEVANT COMPARATOR GROUP.
 
·      THE AVERAGE CORRELATION TO GOLD FOR ROYAL GOLDS SELECTED PEER GROUP COMPANIES IS 90.1% AS DISPLAYED ON THE FOLLOWING CHART.

CORRELATION OF ROYAL GOLD PEER COMPANIES TO LME GOLD PRICE JULY 1, 2012-JUNE 30, 2013
 

 
·      IF ISS HAD USED ROYAL GOLDS COMPENSATION PEER GROUP, RATHER THAN ITS INTERNAL POLICY-GENERATED COMPARATORS, WE BELIEVE WE WOULD HAVE PASSED ISSS CEO COMPENSATION TESTS.
 
ISS PEER GROUP IGNORES MARKET CAPITALIZATION.
 
OUR BOARD BELIEVES THAT MARKET CAPITALIZATION, RATHER THAN REVENUE, IS THE APPROPRIATE PRIMARY CRITERION FOR SELECTING COMPANIES FOR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISION-MAKING FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS (WHICH ARE SUPPORTED BY THE TABLES INCLUDED IN THIS LETTER):
 
·      MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO STOCKHOLDER BENEFIT.
 
·      MARKET CAPITALIZATION, A KEY COMPONENT OF WHICH IS STOCK PRICE, IS THE KEY DRIVER OF THE VALUE OF EQUITY AWARDS, WHICH COMPRISE THE SINGLE LARGEST COMPONENT OF COMPENSATION FOR ROYAL GOLD EXECUTIVES, INCLUDING OUR CEO.
 
·      MARKET CAPITALIZATION AS THE PRIMARY SELECTION CRITERION IS MORE APPROPRIATE THAN REVENUES.  FOR EXAMPLE, ASSUME COMPANIES A AND B HAVE IDENTICAL REVENUES OF $300 MILLION AND BOTH HAVE 100 MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING, BUT COMPANY AS MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS $500 MILLION AS COMPARED TO COMPANY BS $3 BILLION MARKET CAPITALIZATION.  IT IS LOGICAL THAT COMPANY B WOULD PROVIDE MORE COMPENSATION TO ITS CEO.  HOWEVER, THE ISS ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE SAME BECAUSE BOTH COMPANIES HAVE THE SAME REVENUES.
 
ROYAL GOLD IS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE COMPANIES IN THE ISS COMPARATOR GROUP.
 
·      AS WE POINTED OUT ON PAGE 26 OF OUR PROXY STATEMENT, REVENUES ARE A POOR INDICATOR OF ROYAL GOLDS VALUE.  REVENUES OF A TYPICAL BUSINESS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OFFSET BY THE OPERATING COSTS OF THAT BUSINESS.  ROYAL GOLDS INVESTORS UNDERSTAND OUR BUSINESS MODEL, WHICH PROVIDES VERY LOW OPERATING COSTS AND SUPERIOR OPERATING MARGINS COMPARED TO BOTH MINING AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES.  ROYAL GOLD BELIEVES MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS A MUCH BETTER INDICATION OF RELATIVE SIZE FOR PURPOSES OF EXTERNAL BENCHMARKING.  BASED ON MARKET SIZE, ROYAL GOLD IS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN ANY OF THE ISS-IDENTIFIED PEERS:

COMPARISON OF ROYAL GOLDS MARKET CAPITALIZATION TO THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF ISS-IDENTIFIED PEER GROUP COMPANIES
 

 
·      BECAUSE ISS USES MOSTLY MUCH SMALLER COMPANIES IN ITS ANALYSIS, IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT OUR CEOS COMPENSATION WAS VIEWED AS BEING RELATIVELY HIGHER.
 
ISS DISREGARDS OUR PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND GAAP ACCOUNTING.
 
ISS ANALYSIS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IGNORES THAT OUR CEOS COMPENSATION DECLINED 14% IN FISCAL 2013 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2012.  MOREOVER, ISS ASSUMED ALL PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS WILL FULLY VEST, DESPITE CHALLENGING VESTING CRITERIA, AND HAS MODIFIED THE GAAP-BASED DISCLOSURE IN ROYAL GOLDS PROXY STATEMENT TO DISREGARD PERFORMANCE CRITERIA.
 
·      THE AUGUST 2012 PERFORMANCE SHARE GRANTS TO THE COMPANYS CEO HAD A GAAP VALUE OF $828,520, A DECLINE OF OVER 40% FROM THE VALUE OF THE AUGUST 2011 GRANTS, BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE-BASED VESTING CRITERIA. FROM ISSS PERSPECTIVE, THE VALUE OF THE AUGUST 2012 GRANTS INCREASED 12.5% FROM AUGUST 2011 TO $1.7 MILLION. THIS CONCLUSION CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY IGNORING PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND GAAP ACCOUNTING.
 
·      IN ADDITION, ISS OPTION VESTING CALCULATIONS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH GAAP ACCOUNTING AND THOSE MODIFICATIONS FURTHER AMPLIFY THE SUGGESTED VALUE IN THE ISS REPORT.  GAAP ACCOUNTING EXISTS TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT APPROACH TO ACCOUNTING, AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS PRUDENT TO USE A COMBINATION OF ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.
 
ISS MISCHARACTERIZED OUR PERFORMANCE SHARE VESTING CRITERIA.
 
ISS CITED OUR FAILURE TO IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE SHARE VESTING CRITERIA AS A CONCERN.  OUR VESTING CRITERIA IS A 10% COMPOUNDED ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IN ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PER SHARE, AS DISCLOSED IN OUR SEPTEMBER 3, 2013, FORM 8-K REPORT.  WE NOTE THAT ISS INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIES THE METRIC AS GROWTH IN FREE CASH FLOW OVERALL, WHICH WOULD ENCOURAGE DILUTIVE GROWTH AND WOULD BE A MUCH EASIER MEASURE TO ACHIEVE THAN OUR PER SHARE ANNUAL GROWTH PERFORMANCE METRIC.
 
ISS ALSO CITED OUR FAILURE TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC ADJUSTED EBITDA THRESHOLD WHICH MUST BE ACHIEVED BEFORE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS TO OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, INCLUDING OUR CEO, MAY VEST.  BEGINNING IN AUGUST 2012, IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT MEET A MINIMUM ADJUSTED EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND OTHER NON-CASH CHARGES) THRESHOLD FOR A FISCAL YEAR, THEN ALL OF
 
6





 
THE SHARES OF STOCK UNDERLYING THE RESTRICTED STOCK GRANT AWARDED FOR THAT FISCAL YEAR WILL BE FORFEITED.  FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS MADE IN AUGUST 2012 AND 2013, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA THRESHOLD WAS $175 MILLION.  ACTUAL ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS $260.8 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2013, SURPASSING THE THRESHOLD.  WE NOTE THAT THE SAME ADJUSTED EBITDA THRESHOLD MUST BE MET IN ORDER FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, INCLUDING OUR CEO, TO RECEIVE A CASH BONUS FOR THE RELEVANT FISCAL YEAR.
 
LOOKING THROUGH ALL THE ISS NOISE ON MISLEADING COMPARISONS AND MARGINAL DISCLOSURE, ROYAL GOLD DELIVERED RECORD RESULTS IN FISCAL 2013.
 
·      OUR FISCAL 2013 RESULTS INCLUDED YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN REVENUES (10%) AND OPERATING CASH FLOW (6%) DESPITE SIGNIFICANT HEADWINDS IN THE PRECIOUS METALS INDUSTRY IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2013.
 
·      IN FISCAL 2013, WE RETURNED $43.9 MILLION OF CAPITAL TO STOCKHOLDERS, REPRESENTING A PAYOUT RATIO OF 25% OF OPERATING CASH FLOW.
 
WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM OF COMPENSATION BEST PRACTICES.
 
·      SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION FOR FISCAL 2013 WAS PERFORMANCE BASED.  CASH BONUSES, PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS VEST, FOR OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, ONLY IF SPECIFIC FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE ACHIEVED.
 
·      THE COMPANY APPLIES A DOUBLE TRIGGER APPROACH TO VESTING AWARDS MADE UNDER THE COMPANYS 2004 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE-IN-CONTROL.  THIS MEANS THAT VESTING OF THESE AWARDS IS ACCELERATED UPON A CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ONLY IF THE EXECUTIVE IS ALSO TERMINATED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
·      THE COMPANY BELIEVES PERQUISITES FOR EXECUTIVES SHOULD BE EXTREMELY LIMITED IN SCOPE AND VALUE AND, THEREFORE, GENERALLY DOES NOT PROVIDE PERQUISITES OR OTHER SPECIAL BENEFITS TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.
 
·      THE COMPANYS LTIP EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS THE RE-PRICING OF STOCK OPTIONS.
 
·      THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVES MAY PARTICIPATE IN A SALARY REDUCTION/SIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE PENSION PLAN ON THE SAME TERMS AS OTHER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAINTAIN A DEFINED PENSION BENEFIT PLAN.
 
·      THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DO NOT PROVIDE FOR EXCISE TAX GROSS-UPS FOR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PROVISIONS.
 
·      THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM REQUIRES THE COMPANYS NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TO OWN A NUMBER OF SHARES VALUED AT A MULTIPLE OF THEIR SALARY TO ASSURE THAT THEIR INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS.
 
WE INVITE YOU TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE REASONS THE BOARD IS RECOMMENDING A VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 3, ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.
 
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION ON THESE MATTERS AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BOARDS RECOMMENDATION.

OTHER EVENTS  DURING THE CABOT CORPORATION FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2014 EARNINGS CALL ON JANUARY 30,
2014, A QUESTION WAS ASKED BY A CALL PARTICIPANT AND ANSWERED BY PATRICK PREVOST, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF CABOT CORPORATION.  QUESTION FROM KEVIN HOCEVAR,
NORTHCOAST ANALYST:  IN TERMS OF CARBON BLACK ORGANIC VOLUME GROWTH, IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS 10%, 15% WHEN YOU INCLUDE NHUMO. WHAT SHOULD WE THINK
ABOUT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR? IS THAT LEVEL SUSTAINABLE OR ARE WE GOING TO PROBABLY SEE SOME GROWTH, BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT? HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THIS FOR THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR? 
ANSWER PATRICK PREVOST, CABOT CORPORATION PRESIDENT AND CEO: 
I WOULD SAY THAT WERE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE GROWTH FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. WEVE BEEN PLEASED WITH THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS. WE THINK THERE WAS
PENT-UP DEMAND IN TERMS OF THE NEED TO RE-BUILD TIRE INVENTORIES IN THE CHAIN IN MOST GEOGRAPHIES AROUND THE WORLD, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT PERHAPS LOW SINGLE-DIGIT GROWTH RATES FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. 
IN ORDER TO CLARIFY CONFUSION REGARDING THE ANSWER, THE STATEMENT NOTING LOW SINGLE-DIGIT GROWTH RATES FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR WAS REFERENCING
EXPECTED GROWTH IN VOLUMES IN FUTURE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2014 AS COMPARED TO VOLUMES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014. ACCORDINGLY, THIS WAS A COMMENT REGARDING EXPECTATIONS FOR SEQUENTIAL VOLUME GROWTH FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014 AND IT
WAS NOT IN REFERENCE TO FUTURE YEAR OVER YEAR VOLUME GROWTH.  SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. STATEMENTS
IN THIS REPORT REGARDING OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR VOLUME GROWTH ARE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN THE
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS, SEE RISK FACTORS IN THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

AS DESCRIBED IN OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, THE PRINCIPAL RAW MATERIAL USED IN OUR SPECIALTY FLUIDS BUSINESS IS POLLUCITE (CESIUM
ORE), THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH WE OBTAIN FROM OUR MINE IN MANITOBA, CANADA, A PORTION OF WHICH IS LOCATED UNDER BERNIC LAKE. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN LIGHT OF RECENT INDICATIONS OF STRUCTURAL INSTABILITY IN A PORTION OF THE MINE THAT CONTAINS
SIGNIFICANT CESIUM RESERVES, WE HAVE BEEN ASSESSING THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES AT THE MINE TO ENABLE US TO CONTINUE TO ACCESS OUR POLLUCITE RESERVES. FOLLOWING A RECENT REVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES
AND CONSIDERING THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROJECT, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL NOT PROCEED WITH A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AT THE MINE AT THIS TIME. ACCORDINGLY, WITHOUT SUCH A PROJECT, OUR SUPPLY OF CESIUM PRODUCTS
AVAILABLE FROM OUR MINE IS LIKELY TO LAST SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE 10 YEARS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED.  WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUING OUR
CURRENT MINING IN THE PORTIONS OF THE MINE UNAFFECTED BY THE INSTABILITY AND UNDERTAKING ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE, SMALLER SCALE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO MINE APPROXIMATELY 15,000 ADDITIONAL BARRELS OF PURE CESIUM FORMATE FLUID OVER THE
NEXT TWO YEARS. OUR ABILITY TO MINE THIS AMOUNT ASSUMES THERE IS NO FURTHER MAJOR INSTABILITY OF THE MINE THAT PREVENTS ALL MINING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE MIXED INVENTORY ON HAND WHICH APPROXIMATES 24,000 BARRELS OF PURE CESIUM FORMATE
FLUID EQUIVALENT. OUR RECENT CONSUMPTION RATE (FLUID LOST OR SOLD) HAS BEEN APPROXIMATELY 7,000 BARRELS PER YEAR. THE NUMBER OF YEARS THIS AVAILABLE SUPPLY OF CESIUM PRODUCTS WILL LAST IS DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE
CONSUMPTION RATES AND THE TYPES OF INVENTORY ON HAND.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS OPTIONS TO ACCESS THE ADDITIONAL RESERVES IN OUR MINE,
USE VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES TO AUGMENT OUR CESIUM SUPPLY AND SEEK ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ORE. IN LIGHT OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE ARE REVIEWING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY TO ENSURE WE MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO BE MORE
SELECTIVE IN OUR PROJECTS TO MINIMIZE ANNUAL CONSUMPTION, AND MAY REDUCE THE BUSINESSS ANNUAL PROFITABILITY.

(“TWB”), THE SETTLEMENT OF A LEGAL DISPUTE, INCOME FROM INSURANCE PROCEEDS, IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER INCOME AND JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTIONS (IN EACH CASE, AFTER-TAX) FROM NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CONTROLLING INTEREST, AND DIVIDING THE RESULT BY THE AVERAGE DILUTED COMMON SHARES FOR THE PERIOD.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GAAP-BASED FINANCIAL MEASURE OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CONTROLLING INTEREST OF $2.11 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2014 AND THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING AND NONRECURRING CHARGES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF $2.33 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2014, AS MENTIONED IN THE CONFERENCE CALL, IS OUTLINED BELOW.

THE LAST THREE COLUMNS SHOW THE POTENTIAL PAYOUTS WHICH CAN BE EARNED UNDER SHORT-TERM CASH INCENTIVE BONUS AWARDS BASED ON ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIED LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING MAY 31, 2015.  PAYOUTS WHICH CAN BE EARNED UNDER THESE ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE BONUS AWARDS ARE GENERALLY TIED TO ACHIEVING SPECIFIED LEVELS (THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM) OF CORPORATE ECONOMIC VALUED ADDED AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERFORMANCE PERIOD WITH EACH PERFORMANCE MEASURE CARRYING A 50% WEIGHTING.  FOR MR. GILMORE, A STEEL PROCESSING BUSINESS UNIT EXECUTIVE, THE CORPORATE EARNINGS PER SHARE MEASURE CARRIES A 20% WEIGHTING, THE STEEL PROCESSING BUSINESS UNIT OPERATING INCOME CARRIES A 30% WEIGHTING, AND THE STEEL PROCESSING BUSINESS UNIT ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED CARRIES A 50% WEIGHTING.  FOR MR. BILLMAN, A PRESSURE CYLINDERS BUSINESS UNIT EXECUTIVE, THE CORPORATE EARNINGS PER SHARE MEASURE CARRIES A 20% WEIGHTING, THE PRESSURE CYLINDERS BUSINESS UNIT OPERATING INCOME CARRIES A 30% WEIGHTING, AND THE PRESSURE CYLINDERS BUSINESS UNIT ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED CARRIES A 50% WEIGHTING.  FOR ALL CALCULATIONS, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND NON-RECURRING ITEMS ARE GENERALLY EXCLUDED AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AND STEEL PROCESSING BUSINESS UNIT OPERATING INCOME RESULTS ARE ADJUSTED TO ELIMINATE THE IMPACT OF FIFO GAINS AND LOSSES.  IF THE PERFORMANCE LEVEL FALLS BETWEEN THRESHOLD AND TARGET OR BETWEEN TARGET AND MAXIMUM, THE AWARD IS PRORATED.

THE BOARD ALSO APPROVED AN AMENDMENT CLARIFYING THE NON-OFFICER STATUS OF APPOINTED VICE PRESIDENTS BY AMENDING ARTICLE IV, SECTION 4.07 OF THE BYLAWS.


THE NEW MAJORITY VOTING STANDARD PROVIDES THAT TO BE ELECTED IN AN UNCONTESTED ELECTION, A DIRECTOR NOMINEE MUST RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST WITH RESPECT TO THAT NOMINEE’S ELECTION SUCH THAT THE NUMBER OF VOTES CAST “FOR” A NOMINEE’S ELECTION EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF VOTES CAST “AGAINST” THAT NOMINEE’S ELECTION. IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS WHERE THE NUMBER OF NOMINEES EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF DIRECTORS TO BE ELECTED, THE VOTING STANDARD WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PLURALITY OF VOTES CAST.


IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED BYLAWS, THE COMPANY ALSO AMENDED AND RESTATED ITS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES (AS AMENDED, THE “AMENDED CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES”) TO INCLUDE THE REQUIREMENT THAT AN INCUMBENT DIRECTOR WHO FAILS TO RECEIVE THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF VOTES IN AN UNCONTESTED ELECTION TENDER HIS OR HER RESIGNATION TO THE BOARD AND THE BOARD WILL DETERMINE WHETHER TO ACCEPT THE RESIGNATION THROUGH A PROCESS MANAGED BY THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE (THE “NCG COMMITTEE”).

THE BOARD WILL PROMPTLY PUBLICLY DISCLOSE ITS DECISION REGARDING THE TENDERED RESIGNATION, INCLUDING ITS RATIONALE FOR ACCEPTING OR REJECTING THE RESIGNATION OFFER BY FURNISHING A REPORT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE NCG COMMITTEE IN MAKING ITS RECOMMENDATION, AND THE BOARD IN MAKING ITS DECISION, MAY EACH CONSIDER ANY FACTORS OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT IT CONSIDERS APPROPRIATE AND RELEVANT. THE AMENDED CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE AT WWW.COMPASSMINERALS.COM.


THE BOARD MAY ACCEPT A DIRECTOR’S RESIGNATION OR REJECT THE RESIGNATION. IF THE BOARD ACCEPTS A DIRECTOR’S RESIGNATION, THEN THE BOARD, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, MAY FILL ANY RESULTING VACANCY PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3.08 OF THE COMPANY'S BYLAWS OR MAY DECREASE THE SIZE OF THE BOARD PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3.02 OF THE COMPANY'S BYLAWS.

THIS GUIDELINE WILL BE SUMMARIZED OR INCLUDED IN EACH PROXY STATEMENT RELATING TO AN ELECTION OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY.

ON DECEMBER 22, 2014, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC. (THE “COMPANY”) APPROVED THE ADDITION OF AN EXCLUSIVE FORUM SELECTION PROVISION TO THE COMPANY’S BYLAWS. PURSUANT TO THIS NEW PROVISION, UNLESS THE COMPANY CONSENTS IN WRITING TO THE SELECTION OF AN ALTERNATIVE FORUM, THE APPLICABLE STATE COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE (INCLUDING THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY) OR THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE WILL BE THE EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS ENUMERATED IN THE NEW BYLAW ARTICLE X.


THE BOARD BELIEVES THAT ARTICLE X IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STOCKHOLDERS BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER REASONS, THERE IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED BODY OF PRECEDENT IN DELAWARE AND IT IS THE SAME STATE IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INCORPORATED.

THE BOARD EXPECTS THE EXCLUSIVE FORUM TO RESULT IN A MORE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME IN THOSE LEGAL ACTIONS COVERED BY ARTICLE X AND AVOID UNNECESSARY EXPENDITURE OF COMPANY RESOURCES, INCLUDING MONEY AND MANAGEMENT TIME AND ATTENTION. ARTICLE X DOES NOT PRECLUDE ANY TYPE OF LEGAL ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY OR ITS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS OR OTHER EMPLOYEES; RATHER, IT DIRECTS CERTAIN LEGAL ACTIONS TO A SINGLE COURT THAT IS FOCUSED ON AND EXPERIENCED WITH DELAWARE LAW, WITH THE GOAL OF SECURING A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE RESOLUTION OF THOSE LEGAL ACTIONS. ARTICLE X ALSO PRESERVES THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONSENT TO THE SELECTION OF AN ALTERNATIVE FORUM FOR THOSE LEGAL ACTIONS.

RE:                           ROYAL GOLD, INC. ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  NOVEMBER 14, 2014
PROPOSAL 3, ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (SAY ON PAY)
 
DEAR STOCKHOLDER:
 
BY NOW YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED ROYAL GOLD, INC.S NOTICE OF THE 2014 ANNUAL MEETING AND PROXY STATEMENT.  YOU CAN ALSO VIEW OUR PROXY STATEMENT AT WWW.ROYALGOLD.COM.
 
WE WRITE TO ASK FOR YOU TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HEREIN, AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT AT THE ANNUAL MEETING BY VOTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON ALL PROPOSALS, INCLUDING PROPOSAL 3, ADVISORY VOTE ON COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (SAY ON PAY).
 
INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES (ISS) RECOMMENDED A VOTE AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL.  WE ARE COMPELLED TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG DISAGREEMENT WITH ITS RECOMMENDATION.  IN ITS REPORT, ISS BASED ITS RECOMMENDATION LARGELY ON THE SIZE OF OUR CEOS EQUITY AWARDS MEASURED AGAINST A GROUP OF COMPARATOR COMPANIES DETERMINED BY ISS.
 
ISS METHODOLOGIES COMPARE APPLES TO ORANGES AND IN OUR OPINION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY FLAWED, INAPPROPRIATE, AND INVALID FOR A MEANINGFUL EVALUATION OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM.
 
·                  FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH THE PEER GROUP SELECTED BY ISS TO BENCHMARK OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM.  SPECIFICALLY, ISS:
 
·                  FAILED TO COMPARE ROYAL GOLD TO ANY OTHER COMPANY IN THE VERY UNIQUE PRECIOUS METAL ROYALTY AND STREAMING BUSINESS,
 
·                  FAILED TO PROVIDE A PEER GROUP THAT HAS ANY MEANINGFUL CORRELATION TO GOLD, WITH ONLY SEVEN OF THEIR FOURTEEN COMPANIES INVOLVED IN PRECIOUS METAL BUSINESSES, AND
 
·                  FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT ROYAL GOLD IS ONE OF THE 15 LARGEST PRIMARY PRECIOUS METAL COMPANIES IN THE WORLD BY MARKET CAPITALIZATION, AND CONTINUES TO SUGGEST THAT COMPANIES AVERAGING ONE TENTH THE SIZE OF ROYAL GOLD ARE RELEVANT BENCHMARKS.
 
·                  SECOND, ISS DID NOT USE COMPARABLE RESULTS FROM TRAILING 12-MONTH PERIODS ENDING ON JUNE 30 WHEN IT EVALUATED PEER COMPANIES FOR ROYAL GOLD.  SPECIFICALLY, ISS:
 
·                  FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE FISCAL YEARS FOR VARIOUS COMPANIES END AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND. THUS, DOES NOT USE THE SAME PERIOD FOR EACH COMPANY WHEN COMPARING PERFORMANCE RESULTS.
 
·                  THIRD, ISS NON-CASH COMPENSATION CALCULATIONS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH U.S. GAAP ACCOUNTING. THEY DRAMATICALLY AMPLIFY THE SUGGESTED COMPENSATION VALUE IN THE ISS REPORT. SPECIFICALLY, ISS:
 
·                  FAILED TO APPLY U.S. GAAP ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE TO DETERMINE THE VALUE FOR STOCK-BASED OPTION AND PERFORMANCE COMPENSATION, AND
 
·                  FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULTY IN ACHIEVING OUR VESTING CRITERIA FOR PERFORMANCE SHARE COMPENSATION, AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT NO PERFORMANCE SHARES HAVE VESTED SINCE FEBRUARY, 2012.
 
2





 
EACH OF THESE ITEMS IS EXPLAINED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.
 
ISS PEER GROUP IS NOT RELEVANT:
 
THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT TEN PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES WORLDWIDE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE PRECIOUS METAL ROYALTY AND STREAMING BUSINESS.  ALL OF THEM MAINTAIN PRIMARY LISTINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES EXCEPT FOR ROYAL GOLD.  THIS MEANS THAT ALL OF THE COMPANIES MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO ROYAL GOLD ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE UNITED STATES INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION USED BY ISS.  ISS SELECTED SEVEN BROADER MATERIALS INDUSTRY COMPANIES FOR ITS PEER GROUP, AND SEVEN PRECIOUS METAL MINING COMPANIES (SIX DOMICILED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ONE IN CANADA).  ALL OF THE ISS-SELECTED PEERS POSSESS FAR SMALLER MARKET CAPITALIZATIONS THAN ROYAL GOLD.
 
·                  GOLD IS OFTEN NEGATIVELY CORRELATED TO THE BROADER ECONOMY, SO BENCHMARKING ROYAL GOLDS TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN AGAINST CHEMICAL, CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, BASE METALS AND FOREST PRODUCTS COMPANIES IS SIMPLY NOT RELEVANT WHEN DETERMINING RELATIVE PERFORMANCE.
 
·                  TO DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS POINT, ROYAL GOLDS SHARE PRICE HAD A 78% CORRELATION TO THE PRICE OF GOLD OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.  THE CHART BELOW ILLUSTRATES THAT HALF OF THE ISS PEER GROUP HAS NO OR SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE CORRELATION TO THE PRICE OF GOLD.  AS A GROUP, THE ISS PEER GROUP HAS A VERY WEAK 18% CORRELATION TO GOLD.
 

 
THE ROYAL GOLD SELECTED PEER GROUP IS RELEVANT:
 
·                  ROYAL GOLD THOUGHTFULLY CONSTRUCTED AND DISCLOSED ITS PEER GROUP ON PAGES 26 AND 27 OF THE PROXY STATEMENT.  THE GROUP WE SELECTED INCLUDES OUR DIRECT ROYALTY COMPETITORS AND PRECIOUS METAL MINING COMPANIES OF SIMILAR RELATIVE SIZE AS MEASURED BY MARKET CAPITALIZATION.  THIS GROUP CONSISTS OF 13 PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES INCLUDING IAMGOLD, SILVER WHEATON, FRANCO-NEVADA, PAN AMERICAN SILVER, COEUR MINING, HECLA MINING, OSISKO MINING, CENTERRA GOLD, NEW GOLD, ALAMOS GOLD, AURICO GOLD, ELDORADO GOLD AND AGNICO EAGLE.
 
MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE NOT LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES.  HOWEVER, GOLD MINING IS AN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, AND THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT DOMICILE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PRECIOUS METALS COMPANIES TO MAKE A PEER GROUP COMPRISED OF SIMILARLY STATISTICALLY VALID COMPANIES.  FURTHERMORE, THIS IS THE INTERNATIONAL PEER GROUP WITH WHOM WE COMPETE FOR EXECUTIVE TALENT.  WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THIS IS THE RELEVANT COMPARATOR GROUP.  THROUGH ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR STOCKHOLDERS OVER THE PAST YEAR, WE BELIEVE THEY AGREE WITH US.
 
3





 
·                  THE AVERAGE CORRELATION TO GOLD FOR ROYAL GOLDS SELECTED PEER GROUP COMPANIES IS 80% AS DISPLAYED ON THE FOLLOWING CHART.
 

 
OUR BOARD BELIEVES THAT MARKET CAPITALIZATION, RATHER THAN REVENUE, IS THE APPROPRIATE PRIMARY CRITERION FOR SELECTING COMPANIES FOR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISION-MAKING FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS (WHICH ARE SUPPORTED BY THE TABLES INCLUDED IN THIS LETTER).
 
·                  REVENUES OF A TYPICAL BUSINESS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OFFSET BY THE OPERATING COSTS OF THAT BUSINESS.  ROYAL GOLDS INVESTORS UNDERSTAND THAT ITS BUSINESS MODEL PROVIDES VERY LOW OPERATING COSTS AND SUPERIOR OPERATING MARGINS COMPARED TO BOTH MINING AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES.
 
·                  MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO STOCKHOLDER BENEFIT.
 
·                  MARKET CAPITALIZATION, A KEY COMPONENT OF WHICH IS STOCK PRICE, IS THE KEY DRIVER OF THE VALUE OF EQUITY AWARDS, WHICH COMPRISE THE SINGLE LARGEST COMPONENT OF COMPENSATION FOR ROYAL GOLD EXECUTIVES, INCLUDING OUR CEO.
 
·                  MARKET CAPITALIZATION AS THE PRIMARY SELECTION CRITERION IS MORE APPROPRIATE THAN REVENUES.  FOR EXAMPLE, ASSUME COMPANIES A AND B HAVE IDENTICAL REVENUES OF $300 MILLION AND BOTH HAVE 100 MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING, BUT COMPANY AS MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS $500 MILLION AS COMPARED TO COMPANY BS $5 BILLION MARKET CAPITALIZATION.  IT IS LOGICAL THAT COMPANY B WOULD PROVIDE MORE COMPENSATION TO ITS CEO.  HOWEVER, THE ISS ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE SAME BECAUSE BOTH COMPANIES HAVE THE SAME REVENUES.
 
THE ISS PEER GROUP MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS COMPARED TO THAT OF ROYAL GOLD IN THE FOLLOWING CHART.
 
4





 

 
·                  BECAUSE ISS USES MOSTLY MUCH SMALLER COMPANIES IN ITS ANALYSIS, IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT OUR CEOS COMPENSATION WAS VIEWED AS BEING RELATIVELY HIGHER.
 
BY CONTRAST, ROYAL GOLDS MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS JUST OVER HALF THAT OF ITS PEER GROUP AVERAGE AS SHOWN BELOW.
 

 
IF ISS HAD USED ROYAL GOLDS COMPENSATION PEER GROUP, RATHER THAN ITS INTERNAL POLICY-GENERATED COMPARATORS, WE BELIEVE WE WOULD HAVE PASSED ISS CEO COMPENSATION TEST.  A COMPARISON OF ALIGNMENT OF PAY AND PERFORMANCE FOR THE ISS AND ROYAL GOLD PEER GROUPS IS PRESENTED BELOW.
 
5





 

 
ISS MEASUREMENT PERIODS ARE INCONSISTENT.
 
THE SUMMARY FINANCIALS FOR ROYAL GOLD IN THE ISS REPORT PRESENT RESULTS ON OUR FISCAL YEAR BASIS (JULY 1 TO JUNE 30) WHILE REPRESENTING THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE ISS PEER COMPANIES FOR OTHER ANNUAL PERIODS, MOSTLY CALENDAR YEAR END.
 
THE MISMATCH IN MEASUREMENT PERIOD RESULTS IN A VERY MISLEADING COMPARISON TO ROYAL GOLD, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE LACK OF PRECISION IN ISS ANALYTICAL APPROACH.
 
ISS DISREGARDS OUR PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND U.S. GAAP ACCOUNTING.
 
ISS ANALYSIS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IGNORES THAT OUR CEOS TAKE HOME PAY (DEFINED AS ACTUAL BASE SALARY AND BONUS PAID, THE VESTED AND IN-THE-MONEY VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS (VALUED AT THE FISCAL YEAR-END CLOSING STOCK PRICE EACH YEAR), VESTED RESTRICTED SHARES AND VESTED PERFORMANCE SHARES) DECLINED APPROXIMATELY 21% IN FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013.
 
MOREOVER, ISS ASSUMES ALL PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS WILL FULLY VEST, AND HAS DISREGARDED U.S. GAAP-BASED DISCLOSURE IN ROYAL GOLDS PROXY STATEMENT AROUND OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE AWARD VESTING CRITERIA AND ASSUMPTIONS.
 
·                  THE AUGUST 2013 PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED TO THE COMPANYS CEO HAD A U.S. GAAP VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $372,840, A DECLINE OF OVER 50% FROM THE VALUE OF THE AUGUST 2012 PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED, DUE TO AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN ASSUMPTIONS OF PERFORMANCES SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST.  FROM ISS PERSPECTIVE, THE VALUE OF THE AUGUST 2013 GRANTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLIONNEARLY FIVE TIMES THE U.S. GAAP VALUE.  ISS CONCLUSION CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY IGNORING THE PERFORMANCE AWARD VESTING CRITERIA AND U.S. GAAP ACCOUNTING.
 
·                  IN ADDITION, ISS OPTION VESTING CALCULATIONS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH U.S. GAAP ACCOUNTING AND THOSE MODIFICATIONS FURTHER AMPLIFY THE SUGGESTED VALUE IN THE ISS REPORT.  U.S. GAAP ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE EXISTS TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT APPROACH TO ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS PRUDENT TO USE A COMBINATION OF ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.
 
·                  FINALLY, ISS OVERLOOKS THE DIFFICULTY IN ACHIEVING OUR VESTING CRITERIA  A 10% COMPOUNDED ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IN ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PER SHARE.  AS EVIDENCE OF HOW CHALLENGING THIS CRITERIA IS, WE NOTE THAT NO PERFORMANCE SHARES HAVE VESTED SINCE FEBRUARY, 2012.
 
WE INVITE YOU TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE REASONS THE BOARD IS RECOMMENDING A VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 3, ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS), WHICH EXCLUDES (GAIN) LOSS ON SALE OR IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, OTHER OPERATING CREDITS AND CHARGES, NET AND EARLY DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, ADJUSTED FOR A NORMALIZED TAX RATE IS A USEFUL MEASURE FOR EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE EARNINGS AND THAT PROVIDING THIS MEASURE WILL ALLOW INVESTORS TO MORE READILY COMPARE THE EARNINGS REFERRED TO IN THE PRESS RELEASE TO OUR EARNINGS FOR PAST AND FUTURE PERIODS.
