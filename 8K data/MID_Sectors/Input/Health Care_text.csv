ITEM 4.02 NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR A RELATED AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEW


(A)


ON MARCH 17, 2015, THE COMPANY ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING THAT THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT, CONCLUDED THAT THE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON BECAUSE OF AN ERROR IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014, WHICH THEN IMPACTED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, AND THAT THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE RESTATED TO MAKE THE NECESSARY ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS.




ON APRIL 17, 2014, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF HI-TECH PHARMACAL CO., INC. (“HI-TECH”) FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $650.0 MILLION. DURING THE 2014 YEAR-END AUDIT PROCESS, AN ERROR WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF HI-TECH, WHICH RESULTED IN AN OVERSTATED CHARGEBACK RESERVE AS OF APRIL 17, 2014. THE ERROR, WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED ON MARCH 11, 2015, RESULTED FROM AN OVERSTATEMENT OF HI-TECH’S CHARGEBACK RESERVE IN CONNECTION WITH APPLYING THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AT THE CLOSING OF THE HI-TECH ACQUISITION.




THE OVERSTATEMENT IN THE CHARGEBACK RESERVE WAS CAUSED BY A MANUAL ERROR MADE IN PREPARING THE DATA WHEREBY THERE WAS A DUPLICATION OF INVENTORY UNITS HELD BY ONE CUSTOMER UTILIZED IN THE CALCULATION OF THE RESERVE AMOUNT FOR HI-TECH PRODUCTS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.  THE DUPLICATION RESULTED IN AN OVERSTATEMENT OF CHARGEBACK RESERVES BY APPROXIMATELY $8.9 MILLION FOR THE OPENING BALANCE SHEET OF HI-TECH AS OF APRIL 17, 2014. THE CHARGEBACK RESERVE AT THE END OF THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 WAS THEN CALCULATED CORRECTLY, RESULTING IN THE EARLIER OVERSTATED RESERVE AMOUNT BEING INCLUDED IN REVENUE DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2014. THE CORRECTION OF THE ERROR IN THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF PREVIOUSLY REPORTED REVENUE BY $8.9 MILLION, A REDUCTION OF PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PRE-TAX INCOME BY $8.9 MILLION AND A REDUCTION OF PREVIOUSLY REPORTED NET INCOME, GOODWILL AND RETAINED EARNINGS BY $5.6 MILLION, FOR THE COMPANY’S THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014.




THE ERROR WAS LIMITED TO THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014, BUT THE ERROR DID IMPACT THE COMPANY’S PREVIOUSLY FILED RESULTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 (WHICH WERE FILED IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY’S FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014) AND THE COMPANY’S PREVIOUSLY FURNISHED PRELIMINARY RESULTS FOR THE FULL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 (WHICH WERE FURNISHED AS PART OF THE COMPANY’S FORM 8-K ON FEBRUARY 26, 2015 IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014) BECAUSE THE SECOND QUARTER RESULTS WERE INCLUDED WITHIN THOSE PERIODS. THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THIS ERROR FOR THE RESTATED THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 IS TO REDUCE BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.05 PER SHARE. THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THIS ERROR FOR THE RESTATED NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, AND THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, IS TO REDUCE BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.06 AND $0.05 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY.


THE ERROR AND SUBSEQUENT RESTATEMENT IS NON-CASH IN NATURE AND DOES NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES FOR ANY OF THE AFFECTED PERIODS OR THE COMPANY’S LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL POSITION.


THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT THE EFFECT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE RESTATEMENT DISCUSSED ABOVE OF THE COMPANY’S PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014.

THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY CONCLUDED THERE WERE CERTAIN MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND, AS A RESULT, THAT ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE AT THAT DATE. THE COMPANY ALSO PREVIOUSLY CONCLUDED IN EACH OF ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED IN 2014 THAT ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE. IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THERE WERE CERTAIN MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING AN ADDITIONAL MATERIAL WEAKNESS THAT IT HAD INADEQUATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PREVENT OR DETECT MATERIAL ERRORS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARIES. THE ERROR DESCRIBED HEREIN, WHICH REQUIRES THE RESTATEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE QUARTER AND SIX-MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, IS A RESULT OF THIS MATERIAL WEAKNESS.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO CONCLUDED THAT ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, DUE TO THESE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  THESE CONCLUSIONS ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER IN THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WHICH WILL BE FILED TODAY. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN REMEDIATING ITS MATERIAL WEAKNESSES.

ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.  CONTRIBUTION AND PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
ON MARCH 23, 2015, TENET HEALTHCARE CORPORATION, A NEVADA CORPORATION (TENET), ENTERED INTO A CONTRIBUTION AND PURCHASE
AGREEMENT (THE CONTRIBUTION AND PURCHASE AGREEMENT) WITH USPI GROUP HOLDINGS, INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION (USPI HOLDINGS), ULYSSES JV HOLDING I LLC, A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY CORPORATION (ULYSSES HOLDING I),
ULYSSES JV HOLDING II LLC, A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY CORPORATION (ULYSSES HOLDING II, AND TOGETHER WITH ULYSSES HOLDING I, THE USPI LLCS), AND BB BLUE HOLDINGS, INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION (NEWCO). USPI
HOLDINGS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF OWNING AND MANAGING AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTERS, SURGICAL HOSPITALS AND RELATED BUSINESSES. 
PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRIBUTION AND PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AT THE CLOSING, THE USPI LLCS WILL COLLECTIVELY SELL AND CONTRIBUTE 100% OF
THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF USPI HOLDINGS TO NEWCO IN EXCHANGE FOR CERTAIN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF NEWCO (THE USPI CONTRIBUTION) AND TENET WILL SELL AND CONTRIBUTE CERTAIN OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS AND OTHER ASSETS WHICH COMPRISE
TENETS AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER AND IMAGING CENTER BUSINESSES TO NEWCO (THE TENET CONTRIBUTION AND TOGETHER WITH THE USPI CONTRIBUTION, THE CONTRIBUTIONS). TENET WILL ALSO PURCHASE, FOR AN ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF $425
MILLION, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING ADJUSTMENTS FOR POST-SIGNING ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, CERTAIN SHARES OF NEWCO (THE PURCHASE AND TOGETHER WITH THE CONTRIBUTIONS, THE CONTRIBUTION AND
PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS) FROM THE USPI LLCS SUCH THAT, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONTRIBUTION AND PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, TENET WILL OWN 50.1% AND THE USPI LLCS WILL, IN THE AGGREGATE, OWN 49.9% OF THE FULLY DILUTED EQUITY INTERESTS OF NEWCO.
THE AMOUNT OF THE CASH CONSIDERATION IS BASED UPON THE RESPECTIVE VALUATIONS OF USPI HOLDINGS AND TENETS BUSINESSES, WITH THE USPI CONTRIBUTION BEING VALUED AT 12.5X 2014 PRO FORMA EBITDA LESS NET DEBT AND THE TENET CONTRIBUTION BEING VALUED
AT 11.0X 2014 PRO FORMA EBITDA LESS NET DEBT, IN EACH CASE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. AFTER THE CONSUMMATION OF THE CONTRIBUTION AND PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, TENET EXPECTS TO CONSOLIDATE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF NEWCO WITH ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

PURCHASE AGREEMENT. IN EACH YEAR THAT THE USPI LLCS ARE TO DELIVER A PUT AND DO NOT PUT THE FULL 25% OF NEWCO SHARES ALLOWABLE, TENET MAY CALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF NEWCO SHARES THE USPI LLCS PUT AND THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NEWCO SHARES
THE USPI LLCS COULD HAVE PUT THAT YEAR. IN ADDITION, THE STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT CONTAINS CERTAIN OTHER CALL OPTIONS PURSUANT TO WHICH TENET WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE UP TO 100% OF THE VOTING COMMON STOCK OF NEWCO BY 2020. THE PRICING OF THE
PUTS AND CALLS RANGES FROM 9.5X-10.5X FORWARD EBITDA LESS NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS AND NET INDEBTEDNESS (DEPENDING UPON WHICH PARTY IS EXERCISING THE OPTION AND AT WHAT TIME). IN THE EVENT OF A PUT BY THE USPI LLCS, TENET WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO
CHOOSE WHETHER TO SETTLE THE PURCHASE PRICE IN CASH OR SHARES OF TENET COMMON STOCK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A CALL BY TENET, THE USPI LLCS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SETTLE THE PURCHASE PRICE IN CASH OR SHARES OF TENET COMMON STOCK.

THE PRESENTATION WILL BE WEBCAST LIVE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM BY CLICKING ON AN AVAILABLE LINK. WHILE THE FORMAT OF CERTAIN SLIDES MAY HAVE CHANGED, THE CONFERENCE SLIDES CONTAIN MUCH OF THE SAME INFORMATION AS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK FILED IN A CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2014.WHILE THE COMPANY HAS NOT CLOSED ITS BOOKS FOR THE QUARTER OR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE COMPANY WILL SHARE ITS PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS ON THE QUARTER AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES. THESE PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS ON THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 PRIMARILY RELATE TO VOLUME, PRICING, OPERATING EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES, AND LEVERAGE. ADDITIONALLY, ON DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF EHHI HOLDINGS, INC. AND ITS ENCOMPASS HOME HEALTH AND HOSPICE BUSINESS (""ENCOMPASS""). THE COMPANY WILL SHARE INFORMATION RELATED TO ENCOMPASS' PORTFOLIO, OPERATIONAL METRICS, AND PREVIOUS ACQUISITION GROWTH IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES.THE COMPANY REITERATES AS OF THE DATE HEREOF ITS ADJUSTED EBITDA GUIDANCE FOR 2014, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2014 AND OCTOBER 27, 2014 AND DURING THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL HELD ON OCTOBER 28, 2014. THE COMPANY IS REVISING ITS PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE GUIDANCE FOR 2014 FROM A RANGE OF $2.24 TO $2.27 PER SHARE TO A RANGE OF $2.20 TO $2.23 PER SHARE. THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS GUIDANCE ESTIMATES DID NOT INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION, OR $0.06 PER DILUTED SHARE, OF TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF ENCOMPASS. EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE PRESENTED USING INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH.THE COMPANY WILL ALSO ADJUST ITS BUSINESS MODEL FOR 2015 THROUGH 2017. THIS BUSINESS MODEL INCLUDES A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE FOR ADJUSTED EBITDA THAT CHANGED FROM A RANGE OF 4% TO 8% TO A RANGE OF 5% TO 9%. TO ARRIVE AT THE NEW COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE RANGE FOR ADJUSTED EBITDA, THE COMPANY INCLUDED A 2014 BASE YEAR ESTIMATE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR ENCOMPASS.IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL SHARE ITS PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW FOR 2014 AND ITS PRELIMINARY ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ENCOMPASS, AROUND ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW FOR 2015 IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO DISCUSS ITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEPLOYING ITS ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW. WHILE THE COMPANY'S DEPLOYMENT PRIORITIES MAY SHIFT BASED ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, IT CONTINUES TO PRIMARILY FOCUS ON GROWTH, DEBT REDUCTION, AND SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES.THE COMPANY USES “SAME-STORE” COMPARISONS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS AND LINE ITEMS WITHIN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN  ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE “2013 FORM 10‑K”) AND NOTE 4, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 (THE “SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10-Q”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 11, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10-Q, AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2013 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10-Q FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED EBITDA THREE MONTHS ENDED NINE MONTHS ENDED           SEPTEMBER 30, SEPTEMBER 30, YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 2013 2014 2013 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 (IN MILLIONS)NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES$139.6 $142.6 $374.7 $369.4 $470.3 $411.5 $342.7 $331.0 $406.1PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS(8.2) (8.0) (25.0) (22.4) (26.0) (27.0) (21.0) (16.4) (30.7)PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL4.0 4.2 7.6 7.8 9.5 16.1 21.0 17.2 8.8INTEREST EXPENSE AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT                 DISCOUNTS AND FEES27.8 25.3 83.5 73.9 100.4 94.1 119.4 125.6 125.7UBS SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS, GROSS— — — — — — — — (100.0)EQUITY IN NET INCOME OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES1.9 2.0 8.8 8.2 11.2 12.7 12.0 10.1 4.6NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS                 IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS(14.7) (14.1) (44.3) (42.5) (57.8) (50.9) (47.0) (40.9) (33.3)AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNTS AND FEES(3.2) (1.0) (9.5) (3.0) (5.0) (3.7) (4.2) (6.3) (6.6)DISTRIBUTIONS FROM NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES(2.9) (4.6) (9.4) (9.6) (11.4) (11.0) (13.0) (8.1) (8.6)CURRENT PORTION OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)3.2 2.5 9.8 3.0 6.3 5.9 0.6 2.9 (7.0)CHANGE IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES(0.8) (14.4) 43.7 21.8 48.9 58.1 41.4 5.7 9.1NET PREMIUM (RECEIVED) PAID ON BOND ISSUANCE/REDEMPTION(6.3) — (6.3) — 1.7 1.9 22.8 — —CASH (PROVIDED BY) USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES                 OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS(0.2) 1.2 1.0 1.4 1.9 (2.0) (9.1) (13.2) (5.7)OTHER(0.2) (0.2) 2.2 1.3 1.6 0.2 0.6 2.0 1.3ADJUSTED EBITDA$140.0 $135.5 $436.8 $409.3 $551.6 $505.9 $466.2 $409.6 $363.7FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $55.3 MILLION AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ""LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,"" AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 (THE “2014 FORM 10‑K”), WHEN FILED. THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY'S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE 2014 FORM 10‑K, WHEN FILED, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP""), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY'S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

ON MARCH 12, 2015, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS REGISTERED PUBLIC OFFERING OF $300 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.125% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF 100.00% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AND WILL USE THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING, ALONG WITH CASH ON HAND, TO COMPLETE THE REDEMPTION OF THE 8.125% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 IN APRIL 2015. AS A RESULT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD AN APPROXIMATE $21 MILLION, OR $0.12 PER DILUTED SHARE, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2015.

IN EXCHANGE FOR GENERAL MEDICINE’S RELEASE, HEALTHSOUTH AGREED TO PAY AN AMOUNT OF CASH THAT IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY.EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE PRESENTED USING INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH.THE COMPANY USES “SAME-STORE” COMPARISONS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS AND LINE ITEMS WITHIN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT PERIODS AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 (THE “2014 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10‑K, AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT. IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”), THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH.

CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE AND GROWTH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING THE RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AT DIFFERENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF PAST AND PRESENT OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. MANAGEMENT USES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, WHEN PUBLICLY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATION OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS.

IN REGARD TO THE PRESS RELEASE ISSUED JUNE 17, 2015 BY CLEARCORRECT ENTITLED: “USPTO FINDS SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS OF PATENTABILITY EXIST RELATIVE TO ALIGN TECHNOLOGY'S PATENTS AND MOVES TO CANCEL KEY CLAIMS”, ALIGN HAS PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS:






  


·


THE DECISION OF THE US PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (USPTO) TO REEXAMINE CLAIMS IN THREE OF ALIGN’S PATENTS (6,217,325; 6,722,880; 8,070,487) IS A LOW THRESHOLD STANDARD AND THE START OF A PROCESS.







  


·


THE REEXAMINATION PROCESS AT THIS POINT IS IN THE PRELIMINARY STAGE BASED ONLY ON ARGUMENTS PROVIDED BY CLEARCORRECT, AND NO FINAL DECISION HAS BEEN MADE BY THE USPTO.  NOW ALIGN WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND AND PRESENT ITS REBUTTAL ARGUMENTS AND EVIDENCE.







  


·


ALL THREE PATENTS (6,217,325; 6,722,880; 8,070,487) WERE PREVIOUSLY FOUND TO BE VALID BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE (ALJ) AND THE COMMISSION DURING THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION (ITC) INVESTIGATION.  CLEARCORRECT WAS FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED ALL THREE PATENTS.







  


·


REGARDING PATENT 6,217,325: IT WAS PREVIOUSLY REEXAMINED BY THE USPTO DURING THE ORTHOCLEAR LITIGATION AND CONFIRMED AS VALID AND PATENTABLE.







  


·


REGARDING PATENT 6,722,880: ORTHOCLEAR ALSO UNSUCCESSFULLY SOUGHT TO SEEK REEXAMINATION OF PATENT 6,722,880.







  


·


THE CITED PRIOR ART REFERENCES RELIED UPON BY CLEARCORRECT IN THESE REEXAMINATIONS ARE NOT NEW, AND WERE ALL PREVIOUSLY OF RECORD WITH THE USPTO AND WERE CONSIDERED BY THE ORIGINAL PROSECUTION, OR PRIOR REEXAMINATIONS, OR BY THE ALJ AND COMMISSION DURING THE ITC PROCEEDINGS.







  


·


THE PENDING FEDERAL COURT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST CLEARCORRECT IN HOUSTON INVOLVE NINE PATENTS, INCLUDING SEVEN NOT SUBJECT TO THE CURRENT REEXAMINATION PROCESS.







  


·


ALL PREVIOUS REEXAMINATIONS OF ALIGN’S PATENTS HAVE RESULTED IN THE PATENTS BEING CONFIRMED VALID. 







  


·


ALIGN INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS PATENT PORTFOLIO AND VIGOROUSLY ENFORCE ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

INC. (THE COMPANY) AND TWO OF ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, MOLINA INFORMATION SYSTEMS, LLC AND MOLINA MEDICAL MANAGEMENT, INC., ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) FOR AN UNSECURED $250 MILLION REVOLVING
CREDIT FACILITY WITH VARIOUS LENDERS AND SUNTRUST BANK, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, SWING LINE LENDER AND ISSUING BANK. THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE USED TO FINANCE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, PERMITTED ACQUISITIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND FOR OTHER
GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  THE CREDIT FACILITY HAS A TERM OF FIVE YEARS AND ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE
DUE AND PAYABLE ON JUNE 12, 2020. SUBJECT TO OBTAINING COMMITMENTS FROM EXISTING OR NEW LENDERS AND SATISFACTION OF OTHER SPECIFIED CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY MAY INCREASE THE CREDIT FACILITY TO UP TO $350 MILLION. 
BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BEAR INTEREST BASED, AT THE COMPANYS ELECTION, AT A BASE RATE OR AN ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE, PLUS
IN EACH CASE THE APPLICABLE MARGIN. THE BASE RATE IS THE HIGHEST OF (A) THE RATE WHICH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT ANNOUNCES FROM TIME TO TIME AS ITS PRIME LENDING RATE, AS IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME, (B) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE, AS IN EFFECT
FROM TIME TO TIME, PLUS 0.50% PER ANNUM AND (C) A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO ADJUSTED LIBOR FOR A TERM OF ONE MONTH PLUS 1.0% PER ANNUM (ANY CHANGES IN SUCH RATES TO BE EFFECTIVE AS OF THE DATE OF ANY CHANGE IN SUCH RATE). THE ADJUSTED

MAXIMUM RATE OF ALL RESERVE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ANY MEMBER BANK OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM IN RESPECT OF EUROCURRENCY LIABILITIES (AS DEFINED IN REGULATION D OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM). IN ADDITION TO INTEREST
PAYABLE ON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING FROM TIME TO TIME UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PAY A QUARTERLY COMMITMENT FEE OF 0.25% TO 0.375% (BASED UPON THE COMPANYS LEVERAGE RATIO) OF THE UNUSED
AMOUNT OF THE LENDERS COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE APPLICABLE MARGINS RANGE BETWEEN 0.50% TO 1.50% FOR BASE RATE LOANS AND 1.50% TO 2.50% FOR ADJUSTED LIBOR LOANS, IN EACH CASE BASED UPON THE COMPANYS LEVERAGE RATIO. 
ALTHOUGH THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS NOT SECURED BY ANY OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS, TWO OF THE COMPANYS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, MOLINA
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, LLC AND MOLINA MEDICAL MANAGEMENT, INC., HAVE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY GUARANTEED THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. 
THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES USUAL AND CUSTOMARY COVENANTS FOR CREDIT FACILITIES OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING NEGATIVE COVENANTS WITH RESPECT TO,

STATUTORY NET WORTH REQUIREMENT FOR THE COMPANY AND EACH REGULATED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY OF NOT LESS THAN 1.05 TO 1.00.  IN THE EVENT
OF A DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING A PAYMENT DEFAULT, A BREACH OF A COVENANT OR A CROSS-DEFAULT TO OTHER DEBT OF THE COMPANY IN EXCESS OF $30 MILLION, THE LENDERS MAY TERMINATE THE

  -2- 



COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND DECLARE THE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, INCLUDING ALL ACCRUED INTEREST AND UNPAID FEES, PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY. IN ADDITION, IN CASE OF A BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY
EVENT OF DEFAULT, THE COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE. UPON AN ACCELERATION OF THE INDEBTEDNESS AFTER AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, THE LENDERS MAY ENFORCE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CREATED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT

	ON APRIL 20, 2015, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE ""AUDIT COMMITTEE"") OF AKORN, INC. (THE ""COMPANY""), UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUSLY ISSUED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND THE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q/A FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, AND THE DISCLOSURES AND RELATED COMMUNICATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE PERIODS, SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON BECAUSE OF ERRORS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THOSE ASSOCIATED PERIODS. FURTHERMORE, MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON. ADDITIONALLY, THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, KPMG LLP, (""KPMG"") ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, AS WELL AS KPMG'S OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON.



	DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2015, THE COMPANY IDENTIFIED ERRORS RELATED TO UNDERSTATEMENTS OF REBATES AND OTHER SALES ALLOWANCES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN AN OVERSTATEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S NET REVENUE FOR THE AFFECTED PERIODS DESCRIBED ABOVE. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE ERRORS ARE RELATED TO THE COMPANIES AND PRODUCTS ACQUIRED IN 2014, THE FORMATION OF PURCHASING ALLIANCES AMONG SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS AND CHANGING COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS FOR SELECT ACQUIRED PRODUCTS DURING 2014.



	WHILE THE EXACT IMPACT TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED, BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT, THE ERRORS RELATED TO THE UNDERSTATEMENTS OF REBATES AND OTHER SALES ALLOWANCES ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE RESULTED IN AN OVERSTATEMENT TO NET REVENUE AND PRETAX INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $20 MILLION TO $35 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014. THE ALLOCATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE ERRORS AMONG THE AFFECTED QUARTERLY PERIODS HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE ERRORS COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE BASED ON FURTHER REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE AFFECTED PERIODS, INCLUDING DUE TO POTENTIAL IDENTIFICATION OF OTHER ERRORS. ADDITIONAL MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY BE IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE KNOWN OR POTENTIAL ERRORS NOTED ABOVE.



	THE ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED IN RESTATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN AMENDMENTS TO FORMS 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 AND FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014. THE AMENDED FORMS WILL BE FILED PRIOR TO THE FILING OF FORM 10-Q FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2015. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT AS A RESULT OF THE RESTATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TIMELY FILE ITS FORM 10-Q FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015. WHILE THE COMPANY PLANS TO REQUEST A FIVE-DAY EXTENSION TO FILE ITS FORM 10-Q WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE IT WILL MEET THE EXTENDED DEADLINE. THE AMENDED FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 WILL INCLUDE THE REQUIRED RESTATEMENT DISCLOSURES AS DEFINED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION 250-10-50.



	BOTH MANAGEMENT AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAVE DISCUSSED WITH KPMG THE MATTERS DISCLOSED IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE WILL BE CONDUCTING AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ERRORS THAT RESULTED IN THE MISSTATEMENTS, WHICH WILL INVOLVE RETAINING OUTSIDE ADVISORS TO ASSIST IN THE INVESTIGATION.

THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 (THE “2014 FORM 10‑K”) AND NOTE 4, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2015 (THE “MARCH 2015 FORM 10-Q”), WHEN FILED. THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10-K, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 1, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, “NET OPERATING REVENUES,” AND “ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS,” TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE MARCH 2015 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE MARCH 2015 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED, AND IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

SPECIFICALLY, THE COMPANY’S HOME HEALTH AND HOSPICE SEGMENT REMAINS ON TRACK TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $72 MILLION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AFTER NONCONTROLLING INTEREST, EXCLUDING HEALTHSOUTH’S LEGACY 25 HOME HEALTH AGENCIES.THE COMPANY USES “SAME-STORE” COMPARISONS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS AND LINE ITEMS WITHIN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT PERIODS AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR DAY SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE INVESTOR DAY SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE INVESTOR DAY SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 (THE “2014 FORM 10‑K”) AND NOTE 4, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2015 (THE “MARCH 2015 FORM 10-Q”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10‑K, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10‑K AND NOTE 1, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, “NET OPERATING REVENUES,” AND “ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS,” TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE MARCH 2015 FORM 10-Q.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR DAY SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2014 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE MARCH 2015 FORM 10-Q FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.ON JUNE 11, 2015, HEALTHSOUTH CORPORATION (THE “COMPANY”) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, ANNOUNCING THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE THE OPERATIONS OF RELIANT AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE ACQUISITION IS ATTACHED TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K AS EXHIBIT 99.2 (THE “SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES”). THE COMPANY WILL ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF THE ACQUISITION ON ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ADJUSTED EBITDA AND EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE RANGES AFTER THE TRANSACTION CLOSES, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN 2015. THE INFORMATION UNDER THIS ITEM 7.01 ALONG WITH EXHIBIT 99.1 AND EXHIBIT 99.2 ATTACHED HERETO ARE BEING FURNISHED AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), NOR SHALL IT BE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING. THE FURNISHING OF EXHIBIT 99.1 AND EXHIBIT 99.2 ATTACHED HERETO IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A DETERMINATION BY THE COMPANY THAT THE INFORMATION IS MATERIAL OR THAT THE DISSEMINATION OF THE INFORMATION IS REQUIRED BY REGULATION FD.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF RELIANT'S FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES INCLUDE RELIANT'S 2014 REVENUE AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THOSE AMOUNTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF RELIANT AND WERE BASED ON A PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF RELIANT’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY ADJUSTMENTS WERE NECESSARY TO ENSURE COMPARABILITY WITH THE COMPANY’S POLICIES. AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, DIFFERENCES MAY BE IDENTIFIED BETWEEN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE TWO COMPANIES THAT, WHEN CONFORMED, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED. ADDITIONALLY, RELIANT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES IS BEFORE THE REDUCTION FOR AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MINORITY LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS. THE COMPANY REPORTS ADJUSTED EBITDA AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MINORITY LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY CANNOT BE CERTAIN OF THE NUMBER OF MINORITY LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS, IF ANY, THAT WILL BE OUTSTANDING AT CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION. AS DISCUSSED UNDER ITEM 1.01 IN THIS FORM 8‑K, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO ACQUIRE ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS OF THE ENTITIES OPERATING THE RELIANT HOSPITALS, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN INTERESTS, IF ANY, HELD BY THE LIMITED PARTNERS AT CLOSING. NEITHER THE COMPANY'S NOR RELIANT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA OF RELIANT CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCERTAIN STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K, THE PRESS RELEASE, AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO THE PURCHASE PRICE AND THE LIKELIHOOD, TIMING AND EFFECTS OF THE COMPLETION OF THIS ACQUISITION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING PUBLIC STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE MATTERS DESCRIBED HEREIN. ALL SUCH ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS, AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, AND THE COMPANY UNDERTAKES NO DUTY TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVISE SUCH STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS, OR OTHERWISE.

ON MAY 13, 2015 WE ISSUED THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1. IT IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS REPORT BY REFERENCE. THE PRESS RELEASE
PROVIDES AN UPDATE ON THE SERVE-HF CLINICAL TRIAL, WHICH STUDIED ADAPTIVE SERVO-VENTILATION (ASV) THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC CHRONIC HEART FAILURE AND PREDOMINANT CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA. 
THE STUDY DID NOT SHOW A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, BETWEEN PATIENTS TREATED WITH ASV THERAPY AND THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP, IN
THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF TIME TO ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY OR UNPLANNED HOSPITALIZATION FOR WORSENING HEART FAILURE.  A PRELIMINARY
ANALYSIS OF THE DATA IDENTIFIED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT 2.5 PERCENT ABSOLUTE INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY FOR THOSE PATIENTS IN THE TRIAL WHO RECEIVED ASV THERAPY PER YEAR COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. BASED ON THE DATA,
WE ARE WORKING WITH GLOBAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES TO PROACTIVELY REVISE THE LABELS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR RESMED ASV DEVICES TO INCLUDE A CONTRAINDICATION FOR PEOPLE WITH SYMPTOMATIC CHRONIC HEART FAILURE WITH REDUCED LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION
FRACTION (LVEF<45%).  REVENUE FROM OUR ASV FLOW GENERATORS, DURING THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2015,
REPRESENTED LESS THAN 7% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE. WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THOSE ASV FLOW GENERATORS WERE PRESCRIBED FOR PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC CHRONIC HEART FAILURE WITH REDUCED LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION. 
ASV DEVICES REPRESENT LESS THAN 2% OF FLOW GENERATOR DEVICES THAT WE HAVE SHIPPED TO CUSTOMERS. SO WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 98% OF OUR
FLOW GENERATOR FIELD POPULATION WILL NOT INCLUDE THIS CONTRAINDICATION.  WE EXPECT TO INCUR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIELD SAFETY
NOTIFICATION DURING OUR FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2015. WE EXPECT TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL WHEN WE RELEASE OUR EARNINGS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2015.

ON APRIL 30, 2015, TELEFLEX INCORPORATED (THE “COMPANY”) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE (THE “PRESS RELEASE”) ANNOUNCING ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 29, 2015.  A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT. IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”), THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH.  ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARES EXCLUDES, DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD PRESENTED, (I) THE EFFECT OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS; (II) LOSSES AND OTHER CHARGES, INCLUDING ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS, CHARGES RELATED TO FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS, AND CHARGES RELATED TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES, NET OF SPECIFIED REVERSALS, INCLUDING A REVERSAL OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ARRANGEMENTS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2014; (III) AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT DISCOUNT ON THE COMPANY’S CONVERTIBLE NOTES; (IV) INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE; AND (V) TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF, OR EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WITH RESPECT TO, PRIOR YEARS’ TAX MATTERS.

IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES.

ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS DEFINED BELOW, IS USED ON BOTH A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND A SEGMENT BASIS. NO CORPORATE OVERHEAD IS ALLOCATED TO EITHER OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS, SUBJECT TO PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 (THE “2014 FORM 10‑K”) AND NOTE 4, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 (THE “JUNE 2015 FORM 10-Q”), WHEN FILED. THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10-K, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 1, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, “NET OPERATING REVENUES,” AND “ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS,” TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE JUNE 2015 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE JUNE 2015 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED, AND IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

THAT IS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPECT TO BE IN THE LOWER END OF THE FOLLOWING RANGES:•ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $670 MILLION TO $680 MILLION; AND•EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH OF $2.11 TO $2.17.THE COMPANY WILL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015:•INPATIENT REHABILITATION REVENUE GROWTH IS TRACKING TO THE HIGHER END OF THE COMPANY'S GUIDANCE RANGE, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY DISCHARGE GROWTH.•HOME HEALTH AND HOSPICE CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE STRONG VOLUME GROWTH.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS, SUBJECT TO PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 (THE “2014 FORM 10‑K”) AND NOTE 4, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 (THE “JUNE 2015 FORM 10-Q”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10‑K, AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10‑K AND NOTE 1, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, “NET OPERATING REVENUES,” AND “ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS,” TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE JUNE 2015 FORM 10-Q.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2014 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE JUNE 2015 FORM 10-Q FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH.  ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARES EXCLUDES, DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD PRESENTED, (I) THE EFFECT OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS; (II) LOSSES AND OTHER CHARGES, INCLUDING ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS, CHARGES RELATED TO FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS, CHARGES RELATED TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES AND CHARGES RELATED TO A LITIGATION VERDICT AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO A NON-OPERATING JOINT VENTURE, NET OF SPECIFIED REVERSALS, INCLUDING A REVERSAL OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ARRANGEMENTS; (III) AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT DISCOUNT ON THE COMPANY’S CONVERTIBLE NOTES; (IV) INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE; (V) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; AND (VI) TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF, OR EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WITH RESPECT TO, PRIOR YEARS’ TAX MATTERS.

CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE AND GROWTH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING THE RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AT DIFFERENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF PAST AND PRESENT OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. MANAGEMENT USES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, WHEN PUBLICLY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATION OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS.

EASTERN TIME ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2015 IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS DEFINED BELOW, IS USED ON BOTH A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND A SEGMENT BASIS. NO CORPORATE OVERHEAD IS ALLOCATED TO EITHER OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS, SUBJECT TO PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 (THE “2014 FORM 10‑K”) AND NOTE 4, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (THE “SEPTEMBER 2015 FORM 10-Q”), WHEN FILED. THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10-K, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 1, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, “NET OPERATING REVENUES,” AND “ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS,” TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE SEPTEMBER 2015 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.

IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”), THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH.

IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED SHARES WITHIN ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GIVES EFFECT TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY’S CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS, WHICH REDUCE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DILUTION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD OCCUR UPON CONVERSION OF THE COMPANY’S SENIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE NOTES (UNDER GAAP, THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTED IN DILUTED SHARES).  CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE AND GROWTH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING THE RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AT DIFFERENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF PAST AND PRESENT OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. MANAGEMENT USES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, WHEN PUBLICLY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATION OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS.

REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.  ON FEBRUARY 17, 2016, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT
OF CALIFORNIA (THE DISTRICT COURT) ISSUED A FAVORABLE RULING ON THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION FILED BY NUVASIVE, INC. (THE COMPANY) IN THE THIRD PHASE OF THE COMPANYS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION WITH WARSAW
ORTHOPEDIC, INC., MEDTRONIC SOFAMOR DANEK USA, INC. AND OTHER MEDTRONIC RELATED ENTITIES (COLLECTIVELY, MEDTRONIC). THE DISTRICT COURT FOUND THAT THE COMPANYS OSTEOCEL PLUS BIOLOGICS PRODUCTS DO NOT INFRINGE MEDTRONICS
ASSERTED PATENT CLAIMS, AND THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION. THIS RULING DOES NOT AFFECT THE STATUS OF THE COMPANYS ONGOING LITIGATION WITH MEDTRONIC IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE CASE, WHICH HAS BEEN REMANDED
BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.  ON FEBRUARY 22, 2016, AN UNFAVORABLE JURY VERDICT WAS DELIVERED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN ITS

DAMAGES, AND APPROXIMATELY $300,000 IN CONTRACT DAMAGES. THE DISTRICT COURT, HOWEVER, HAS INDICATED THAT MMI WOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER BOTH THE $7.5 MILLION AND $14.0 MILLION AMOUNTS. THEREFORE, THE DISTRICT COURT INTENDS TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT
OF THE DAMAGES AWARD AND IS NOW CONSIDERING POST-TRIAL MOTIONS PRIOR TO ISSUING A JUDGMENT AND CONFIRMING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGES TO BE AWARDED AS PART OF ITS JUDGMENT. THE COMPANY STRONGLY DISAGREES WITH THE VERDICT AND THE DAMAGES AWARDED
BY THE JURY AND INTENDS TO FILE POST-TRIAL MOTIONS IN THE DISTRICT COURT SEEKING JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW, AND, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A NEW TRIAL. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO APPEAL IN THE EVENT ITS POST-TRIAL MOTIONS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL AND A JUDGMENT IS
ENTERED BY THE DISTRICT COURT. IN THE EVENT THE COMPANYS POST-TRIAL MOTIONS ARE DENIED AND JUDGMENT IS ULTIMATELY ENTERED BY THE DISTRICT COURT, ANY PAYMENT OF DAMAGES PER THE JUDGMENT WILL BE STAYED PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE APPEALS PROCESS.

EFFECTIVE AS OF MARCH 16, 2016, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH EACH OF
DR. J. MARIO MOLINA, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT, AND JOHN C. MOLINA, OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. 
THE AMENDED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS REMOVED THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 280G GROSS-UP
PROVISION. INSTEAD OF RECEIVING A GROSS-UP, THE EXECUTIVE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN AUTOMATIC REDUCTION IN HIS CHANGE IN CONTROL PAYMENTS IF DOING SO RESULTS IN A GREATER AFTER-TAX PAYMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE THAN HE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IF HE HAD ACCEPTED
THE FULL PAYMENTS AND PAID THE EXCISE TAX.  THE AMENDED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS PROVIDE THAT ALL AMOUNTS PAYABLE THEREUNDER ARE
SUBJECT TO OUR CLAW BACK POLICY, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE.  IN ADDITION, THE SEVERANCE PROVISION HAS BEEN CHANGED TO PROVIDE
FOR THE PAYMENT OF 400% OF THE EXECUTIVES BASE SALARY THEN IN EFFECT UPON HIS TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE OR RESIGNATION FOR GOOD REASON. THE EXECUTIVES REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR A PRORATED TERMINATION BONUS UPON A TERMINATION WITHOUT
CAUSE OR FOR GOOD REASON, AND THE TERMINATION AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN INCREASED TO 150% OF BASE SALARY FOR DR. MOLINA AND 125% OF BASE SALARY FOR JOHN MOLINA. THE BALANCE OF THE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS MADE UPON A TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE OR FOR
GOOD REASON REMAIN UNCHANGED FROM THE EXECUTIVES PREVIOUS FORM OF EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ACCELERATED VESTING OF PREVIOUSLY GRANTED EQUITY COMPENSATION AND A CASH PAYMENT OF $65,000 REPRESENTING 18 MONTHS WORTH OF CONTINUING
HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS. PAYMENT OF SEVERANCE BENEFITS IS CONTINGENT UPON THE EXECUTIVES SIGNING A RELEASE AGREEMENT WAIVING CLAIMS AGAINST US. THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS PROVIDE THAT IF AN EXECUTIVES EMPLOYMENT IS TERMINATED WITHOUT CAUSE OR IS TERMINATED BY THE EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD REASON WITHIN TWO YEARS FOLLOWING A CHANGE OF CONTROL, THE
COMPANY WILL PROVIDE THE EXECUTIVE AS A SEVERANCE PAYMENT WITH FOUR TIMES THE EXECUTIVES ANNUAL BASE SALARY, PLUS THE PRORATED TERMINATION BONUS, A CASH PAYMENT OF $135,000 REPRESENTING 36 MONTHS WORTH OF CONTINUING HEALTH
AND WELFARE BENEFITS, ACCELERATED VESTING OF ALL UNASSUMED AND UNVESTED EQUITY COMPENSATION UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL AND ACCELERATED VESTING OF PREVIOUSLY GRANTED EQUITY COMPENSATION.

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE (THE “AUDIT COMMITTEE”) OF THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AKORN, INC. DISMISSED KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ON JANUARY 10, 2016.
 
IN A FORM 8-K DATED APRIL 24, 2015, WE REPORTED THAT THE AUDIT
COMMITTEE, UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, CONCLUDED THAT OUR PREVIOUSLY ISSUED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR
THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND THE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN OUR
QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q/A FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 AND THE DISCLOSURES AND RELATED COMMUNICATIONS
FOR EACH OF THESE PERIODS SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON BECAUSE OF ERRORS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THOSE ASSOCIATED PERIODS.
FURTHERMORE, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT OUR MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON. BECAUSE OF THE PENDING RESTATEMENT OF THE ABOVE REFERENCED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS, THE RELATED AUDIT REPORTS AND OPINION OF KPMG ON THE CONSOLIDATED AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER
31, 2014 AS WELL AS KPMG’S OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,
2014 HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN. WHEN ORIGINALLY ISSUED, KPMG’S AUDIT REPORTS ON THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2013 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014, DID NOT CONTAIN ANY ADVERSE OPINION OR DISCLAIMER OF OPINION AND SUCH REPORTS WERE NOT QUALIFIED
OR MODIFIED AS TO UNCERTAINTY, AUDIT SCOPE, OR ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE, EXCEPT THAT THE REPORTS ON OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING CONTAINED AN ADVERSE OPINION DUE TO MATERIAL WEAKNESSES. THE COMPANY ACQUIRED HI TECH PHARMACAL CO, INC. (HI TECH), AND
VPI HOLDINGS CORP. INC. (VERSAPHARM) DURING 2014, AND WE ALSO EXCLUDED FROM OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL

ASSOCIATED WITH TOTAL ASSETS OF $254,257,000 AND $13,801,000, RESPECTIVELY, AND TOTAL REVENUES OF $164,825,000 AND $9,173,000,
RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AKORN, INC. AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014.
KPMG’S AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF AKORN, INC. AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 ALSO
EXCLUDED AN EVALUATION OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF HI TECH AND VERSAPHARM.
 
DURING OUR FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND DECEMBER
31, 2014 AND DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 2014 TO THE DATE HEREOF, THERE WERE NO “DISAGREEMENTS”
(AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN ITEM 304(A)(1)(IV) OF REGULATION S-K AND THE RELATED INSTRUCTIONS) BETWEEN KPMG AND US ON ANY MATTER
OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE OR PRACTICES, FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURE OR AUDITING SCOPE OR PROCEDURE, WHICH DISAGREEMENTS, IF NOT
RESOLVED TO KPMG’S SATISFACTION, WOULD HAVE CAUSED IT TO MAKE REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE DISAGREEMENT IN CONNECTION
WITH ITS REPORTS. DURING OUR FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD SUBSEQUENT
TO DECEMBER 31, 2014 TO THE DATE HEREOF, THERE WERE NO “REPORTABLE EVENTS” AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN ITEM 304(A)(1)(V)
OF REGULATION S-K EXCEPT FOR.
 

1.THE IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 9A OF OUR FORM
10-KS FOR THE ANNUAL PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014.
 

2.KPMG ADVISED US THAT INFORMATION HAD COME TO ITS ATTENTION, THAT IF FURTHER INVESTIGATED MAY: (I) MATERIALLY IMPACT
THE FAIRNESS OR RELIABILITY OF EITHER: A PREVIOUSLY ISSUED AUDIT REPORT OR THE UNDERLYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; OR THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS ISSUED OR TO BE ISSUED COVERING THE FISCAL PERIOD(S) SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE OF THE MOST RECENT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
COVERED BY AN AUDIT REPORT (INCLUDING INFORMATION THAT MAY PREVENT IT FROM RENDERING AN UNQUALIFIED AUDIT REPORT ON THOSE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS), OR (II) CAUSE IT TO BE UNWILLING TO RELY ON MANAGEMENT'S REPRESENTATIONS OR BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGISTRANT'S FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS. KPMG ALSO ADVISED US THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE’S CONCLUSION THAT OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE QUARTERS
ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 AND THE DISCLOSURES AND RELATED COMMUNICATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE PERIODS SHOULD NOT
BE RELIED, INFORMATION HAS COME TO ITS ATTENTION, THAT IF FURTHER INVESTIGATED MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2014 AND OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.
 

3.DUE TO THE DISMISSAL, KPMG ADVISED US THAT IT DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF ITS AUDIT, CONDUCT FURTHER
PROCEDURES, EVALUATE THE INVESTIGATION (DESCRIBED BELOW) OR COMPLETE ITS PROCESS. KPMG FURTHER ADVISED US THAT, AT THE TIME OF
ITS DISMISSAL, KPMG HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT ITS PROCEDURES OR CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS SATISFIED WITH THE INVESTIGATION
OR THAT ANY REMEDIATION HAS TAKEN PLACE.
 
AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 8-K, THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED
MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTINUE TO EXIST, AND AKORN’S MANAGEMENT IS CONSIDERING
THE COMPANY’S PRIOR CONCLUSIONS OF THE ADEQUACY OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES, AND RELATED MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN SUCH CONTROLS. AKORN INTENDS TO AMEND CERTAIN PRIOR DISCLOSURES PERTAINING TO
ITS EVALUATION OF SUCH CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, AND MATERIAL WEAKNESSES, AS APPROPRIATE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY AMENDED FILINGS,
AND WILL CONSIDER WHETHER ANY FURTHER REMEDIAL MEASURES MAY BE ADVISABLE AS OF AND FOR ANY OF THE FISCAL YEARS NOTED ABOVE.
 
IN APRIL 2015, UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF AKORN’S MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS,
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE COMMENCED AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION CONCERNING ACCOUNTING ERRORS INVOLVING TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO SALES
TO WHOLESALERS, DIRECT PURCHASERS AND OTHER RELATED TRANSACTIONS. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED TWO ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING
MATTERS THAT WARRANTED FURTHER EXAMINATION AND REVIEW: (I) CUSTOMER PAYMENT TERM MODIFICATIONS AND RELATED REVENUE RECOGNITION
PRACTICES, TIMING AND DISCLOSURES FOR 2013 THROUGH 2015 AND (II) RETURNS PROCESSING DELAYS IN 2015. THIS INVESTIGATION WAS EXPANDED
TO COVER THESE MATTERS AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE. WITH RESPECT TO THESE ADDITIONAL MATTERS, KPMG ADVISED US THAT INFORMATION
HAD COME TO ITS ATTENTION, THAT IF FURTHER INVESTIGATED MAY: (I) MATERIALLY IMPACT THE FAIRNESS OR RELIABILITY OF EITHER: A PREVIOUSLY
ISSUED AUDIT REPORT OR THE UNDERLYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; OR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED OR TO BE ISSUED COVERING THE FISCAL
PERIOD(S) SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE OF THE MOST RECENT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COVERED BY AN AUDIT REPORT (INCLUDING INFORMATION THAT
MAY PREVENT IT FROM RENDERING AN UNQUALIFIED AUDIT REPORT ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), OR (II) CAUSE IT TO BE UNWILLING TO RELY
ON MANAGEMENT'S REPRESENTATIONS OR BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGISTRANT'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS AUTHORIZED KPMG TO RESPOND FULLY TO
THE INQUIRIES OF OUR SUCCESSOR AUDITOR BDO USA, LLP (“BDO”). WE HAVE FURNISHED A COPY OF THE ABOVE DISCLOSURE IN ITEM
4.01 TO KPMG AND REQUESTED THAT KPMG FURNISH US WITH A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (“SEC”)
STATING WHETHER OR NOT KPMG AGREES WITH SUCH DISCLOSURE. A COPY OF KPMG’S LETTER WILL BE FILED AS AN AMENDMENT TO THIS FORM
8-K TO ALLOW KPMG TIME TO RESPOND TO OUR REQUEST.
 
(B) NEWLY ENGAGED INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT
 
ON JANUARY 14, 2016 THE AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVED THE ENGAGEMENT
OF BDO AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. BDO WAS ENGAGED TO PERFORM INDEPENDENT AUDIT
SERVICES FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015.
 
DURING OUR FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND DECEMBER
31, 2015, AND FROM JANUARY 1, 2016 THROUGH THE DATE OF THE ENGAGEMENT, NEITHER WE, NOR ANYONE ON OUR BEHALF, CONSULTED BDO REGARDING
EITHER (I) THE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES TO A SPECIFIED TRANSACTION, EITHER COMPLETED OR PROPOSED, OR THE TYPE OF AUDIT
OPINION THAT MIGHT BE RENDERED WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND NO WRITTEN REPORT OR ORAL ADVICE WAS
PROVIDED US BY BDO THAT BDO CONCLUDED WAS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR CONSIDERED BY US IN REACHING A DECISION AS TO ANY ACCOUNTING, AUDITING
OR FINANCIAL REPORTING ISSUE; OR (II) ANY MATTER THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF A “DISAGREEMENT” OR A “REPORTABLE EVENT”.

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.2 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, LEVERAGE RATIO, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW. THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH (“ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE”). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE PROVIDES A BETTER MEASURE OF ITS ONGOING PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDES BETTER COMPARABILITY OF THAT PERFORMANCE TO PRIOR PERIODS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL, GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS), ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES AS THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM IT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE AS PRESENTED TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES AND THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND EXHIBIT 99.2, RESPECTIVELY.THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES AND THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND EXHIBIT 99.2, RESPECTIVELY, AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 (THE “2014 FORM 10‑K”) AND NOTE 4, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (THE “SEPTEMBER 2015 FORM 10-Q”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10‑K, AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP, AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2014 FORM 10‑K AND NOTE 1, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, “NET OPERATING REVENUES,” AND “ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS,” TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE SEPTEMBER 2015 FORM 10-Q.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2014 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2015 FORM 10-Q FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH (“ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE”). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE PROVIDES USEFUL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES BETTER COMPARABILITY OF ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE TO PRIOR PERIODS GIVEN THAT IT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL, GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS), ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS. IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE EXCLUDED ITEMS WILL OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THEY CAN COMPLICATE COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACROSS PERIODS AND COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS TO THOSE OF OTHER HEALTHCARE COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES AS THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM IT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”) AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE AS PRESENTED TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2.THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 (THE “2015 FORM 10‑K”), WHEN FILED. THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION, AND (4) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP, AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2015 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

ET ON TUESDAY, MARCH 15, 2016 AND REFERENCE SELECTED SLIDES INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK. THE PRESENTATION WILL BE WEBCAST LIVE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM BY CLICKING ON AN AVAILABLE LINK.THE COMPANY IS PLEASED WITH ITS START TO 2016 AND CONFIRMS CURRENT PERFORMANCE IS IN LINE WITH THE EXPECTATIONS EMBEDDED IN ITS GUIDANCE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K DATED FEBRUARY 23, 2016 AND DURING THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL HELD ON FEBRUARY 24, 2016. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPECT THE FOLLOWING FULL-YEAR 2016 RANGES:•NET OPERATING REVENUES OF $3,550 MILLION TO $3,650 MILLION;•ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $765 MILLION TO $785 MILLION; AND•ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH OF $2.32 TO $2.44.THE COMPANY USES “SAME-STORE” COMPARISONS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS AND LINE ITEMS WITHIN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, LEVERAGE RATIO, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW. THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH (“ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE”). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE PROVIDES USEFUL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES BETTER COMPARABILITY OF ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE TO PRIOR PERIODS GIVEN THAT IT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL, GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS), ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS. IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE EXCLUDED ITEMS WILL OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THEY CAN COMPLICATE COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACROSS PERIODS AND COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS TO THOSE OF OTHER HEALTHCARE COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”) AS THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM IT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE AS PRESENTED TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1.THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 (THE “2015 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION, AND (4) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.

ON FEBRUARY 25, 2016, TELEFLEX INCORPORATED (THE “COMPANY”) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE (THE “PRESS RELEASE”) ANNOUNCING ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015.

IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED SHARES WITHIN ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GIVES EFFECT TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY’S CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS, WHICH REDUCE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DILUTION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD OCCUR UPON CONVERSION OF THE COMPANY’S SENIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE NOTES (UNDER GAAP, THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTED IN DILUTED SHARES).  CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE AND GROWTH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING THE RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AT DIFFERENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.

IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. MANAGEMENT USES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, WHEN PUBLICLY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATION OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. HOWEVER, SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS PRESENTED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. SEE ITEM 2.02, “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION,” ABOVE.IN ADDITION, A COPY OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED DURING THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS CALL AT 9:00 A.M. EASTERN TIME ON WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27, 2016 IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, LEVERAGE RATIO, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW.THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH (“ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE”). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE PROVIDES USEFUL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES BETTER COMPARABILITY OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE TO PRIOR PERIODS GIVEN THAT IT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL, MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS), ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS. IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE EXCLUDED ITEMS WILL OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THEY CAN COMPLICATE COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACROSS PERIODS AND COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS TO THOSE OF OTHER HEALTHCARE COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”) AS THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM IT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE AS PRESENTED TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2.THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 (THE “2015 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION, AND (4) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP, AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2015 FORM 10-K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE MARCH 2016 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED, AND IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 (THE “2015 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA”, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION, AND (4) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP, AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2015 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2015 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”), THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.

IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES.

ENTRY INTO MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS.  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS 
ON AUGUST 2, 2016, MOLINA HEALTHCARE, INC. (THE COMPANY) ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT (THE AETNA APA) WITH
AETNA INC. (AETNA) TO PURCHASE AND ACQUIRE FROM AETNA (THE AETNA ACQUISITION) CERTAIN OF AETNAS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE ASSETS IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH. ALSO ON AUGUST 2, 2016, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS ENTERED INTO
A SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT (THE HUMANA APA AND, TOGETHER WITH THE AETNA APA, THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND EACH, AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT) WITH HUMANA INC. (HUMANA AND,
TOGETHER WITH AETNA, THE SELLERS AND EACH, A SELLER) TO PURCHASE AND ACQUIRE FROM HUMANA (THE HUMANA ACQUISITION AND, TOGETHER WITH THE AETNA ACQUISITION, THE ACQUISITIONS) CERTAIN OF HUMANAS
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE ASSETS IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CASH CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACQUISITIONS IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $117 MILLION, EXCLUSIVE OF ANY REQUIRED REGULATORY CAPITAL, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BASED
ON THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS AT CLOSING.  THE ACQUISITIONS ARE RELATED TO AETNAS PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF HUMANA (THE AETNA-HUMANA
MERGER). ON JULY 21, 2016, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (THE DOJ) AND CERTAIN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL FILED A CIVIL COMPLAINT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AGAINST AETNA AND HUMANA CHARGING THAT THE
AETNA-HUMANA MERGER WOULD VIOLATE SECTION 7 OF THE CLAYTON ANTITRUST ACT, AND SEEKING A PERMANENT INJUNCTION TO PREVENT AETNA FROM ACQUIRING HUMANA (THE DOJ LITIGATION). THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS
ARE CONDITIONED ON SEPARATE CLOSING CONDITIONS INCLUDED IN EACH OF THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING THE COMPLETION OF THE AETNA-HUMANA MERGER AND THE RESOLUTION OF THE DOJ LITIGATION, AS WELL AS APPROVAL BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &
MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) OF THE NOVATION TO THE COMPANY OF EACH OF THE CONTRACTS TO BE DIVESTED UNDER EACH OF THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING APPROVALS OF STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE AND OTHER
REGULATORS. AS A RESULT, THE TIME NECESSARY TO CLOSE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY EACH OF THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS ULTIMATELY TO BE TRANSFERRED AT CLOSING PURSUANT TO EACH ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT, ARE
UNCERTAIN; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SELLERS HAVE AGREED TO SELL THE RIGHTS TO A MINIMUM NUMBER OF MEMBERS TO THE COMPANY IN THE EVENT THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESOLUTION OF THE DOJ LITIGATION, THE SELLERS ARE REQUIRED TO DIVEST FEWER MEMBERS
THAN ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED.  EACH ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTIES, AND CUSTOMARY COVENANTS
REGARDING THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY THE APPLICABLE SELLER PRIOR TO THE CLOSING. EACH ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT ALSO GRANTS THE COMPANY, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AN EXCLUSIVE IRREVOCABLE OPTION TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS (AS DEFINED IN
EACH ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT), IF ANY, PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF AETNA-HUMANA MERGER, ON TERMS SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THOSE SET FORTH IN THE APPLICABLE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND AT A PURCHASE PRICE CALCULATED AS DESCRIBED THEREIN. IN
CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, EACH SELLER HAS AGREED TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES RELATED TO THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE ACQUISITIONS FOR A
TRANSITION PERIOD FOLLOWING THE CLOSING.

DISTRICT COURT OVERSEEING THE DOJ LITIGATION HAS NOTIFIED SELLER OR THE COMPANY OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES IN WRITING THAT THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT ARE NOT AN ACCEPTABLE REMEDY OR (III) THE DOJ LITIGATION HAS
BEEN RESOLVED, AND SUCH RESOLUTION DOES NOT REQUIRE SELLER TO DIVEST INDIVIDUAL MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN CONTRACTS IN ANY OF THE GEOGRAPHIES TO BE DIVESTED PURSUANT TO SUCH ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT;

THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, LEVERAGE RATIO, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW.THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH (“ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE”). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE PROVIDES USEFUL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES BETTER COMPARABILITY OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE TO PRIOR PERIODS GIVEN THAT IT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL, MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS), ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE EXCLUDED ITEMS WILL OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THEY CAN COMPLICATE COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACROSS PERIODS AND COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS TO THOSE OF OTHER HEALTHCARE COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”) AS THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM IT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE AS PRESENTED TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2.THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 (THE “2015 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION, AND (4) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. ITEMS FALLING WITHIN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT’S “UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING” CLASSIFICATION MAY OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THESE ITEMS AND AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP, AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2015 FORM 10-K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE JUNE 2016 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED, AND IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. EXCLUDING NET OPERATING REVENUES, THE COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON A GAAP BASIS BECAUSE IT IS UNABLE TO PREDICT, WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY, THE FUTURE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. SUCH ITEMS INCLUDE GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES-ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL, MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS), ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. THESE ITEMS ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, AND COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSTHE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION INCLUDES CERTAIN ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS, AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS AND RELATE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUTURE EVENTS, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS STRATEGY, FINANCIAL PLANS, DIVIDEND STRATEGIES OR PAYMENTS, EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES, PLANS TO REPURCHASE ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES, FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, PROJECTED BUSINESS RESULTS OR MODEL, ABILITY TO RETURN VALUE TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS, PROJECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, LEVERAGE RATIO, ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, AND THE IMPACT OF FUTURE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION.

REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.SUBSEQUENT TO ITS EARNINGS RELEASE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016, HEALTHSOUTH CORPORATION (THE “COMPANY” OR “HEALTHSOUTH”) ASSEMBLED AN INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8‑K AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE (THE “INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK”). THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ADDRESSES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY AND ITS INDUSTRY, ITS BUSINESS OUTLOOK, ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL METRICS AND INITIATIVES, AND ITS VALUE PROPOSITION. THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM BY CLICKING ON AN AVAILABLE LINK.THE COMPANY REITERATES ITS GUIDANCE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K, DATED JULY 28, 2016, AND DURING THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL HELD ON JULY 29, 2016. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPECT THE FOLLOWING FULL-YEAR 2016 RANGES:•NET OPERATING REVENUES OF $3,600 MILLION TO $3,700 MILLION;•ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $775 MILLION TO $795 MILLION; AND•ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH OF $2.44 TO $2.56.THE COMPANY USES “SAME-STORE” COMPARISONS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS AND LINE ITEMS WITHIN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, LEVERAGE RATIO, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW. THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH (“ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE”). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE PROVIDES USEFUL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES BETTER COMPARABILITY OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE TO PRIOR PERIODS GIVEN THAT IT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL, MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS), ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE EXCLUDED ITEMS WILL OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THEY CAN COMPLICATE COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACROSS PERIODS AND COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS TO THOSE OF OTHER HEALTHCARE COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”) AS THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM IT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE AS PRESENTED TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1.THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 (THE “2015 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION, AND (4) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. ITEMS FALLING WITHIN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT’S “UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING” CLASSIFICATION MAY OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THESE ITEMS AND AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP, AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2015 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2015 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. EXCLUDING NET OPERATING REVENUES, THE COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON A GAAP BASIS BECAUSE IT IS UNABLE TO PREDICT, WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY, THE FUTURE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. SUCH ITEMS INCLUDE GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES-ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL, MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS), ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. THESE ITEMS ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, AND COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED EBITDA  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,(MILLIONS) 2016 2015 2016 2015 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES $152.2 $102.9 $311.9 $204.9 $484.8 $444.9 $470.3 $411.5 $342.7PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS (15.4) (10.9) (31.9) (22.5) (47.2) (31.6) (26.0) (27.0) (21.0)PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL 1.7 0.1 1.9 2.3 3.0 9.3 9.5 16.1 21.0INTEREST EXPENSE AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNTS AND FEES 43.4 30.9 88.0 62.7 142.9 109.2 100.4 94.1 119.4EQUITY IN NET INCOME OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES 2.4 2.3 4.8 3.9 8.7 10.7 11.2 12.7 12.0NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS (18.6) (17.3) (37.3) (33.8) (69.7) (59.7) (57.8) (50.9) (47.0)AMORTIZATION OF DEBT-RELATED ITEMS (3.4) (3.0) (6.8) (6.3) (14.3) (12.7) (5.0) (3.7) (4.2)DISTRIBUTIONS FROM NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (1.3) (1.8) (3.0) (3.7) (7.7) (12.6) (11.4) (11.0) (13.0)CURRENT PORTION OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE 4.0 3.4 9.0 6.9 14.8 13.3 6.3 5.9 0.6CHANGE IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 36.9 45.2 55.2 101.2 147.1 90.1 48.9 58.1 41.4NET PREMIUM PAID ON BOND ISSUANCE/REDEMPTION 2.0 11.8 3.9 3.8 3.9 4.3 1.7 1.9 22.8CASH USED IN (PROVIDED BY) OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 0.3 0.2 0.5 0.3 0.7 1.2 1.9 (2.0) (9.1)TRANSACTION COSTS — 3.3 — 3.3 12.3 9.3 — — —OTHER 0.1 2.4 0.2 2.6 3.2 1.9 1.6 0.2 0.6ADJUSTED EBITDA $204.3 $169.5 $396.4 $325.6 $682.5 $577.6 $551.6 $505.9 $466.2FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $66.0 MILLION AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY’S ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, LEVERAGE RATIO, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW. THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH (“ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE”). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE PROVIDES USEFUL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES BETTER COMPARABILITY OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE TO PRIOR PERIODS GIVEN THAT IT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL, MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS), ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE EXCLUDED ITEMS WILL OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THEY CAN COMPLICATE COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACROSS PERIODS AND COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS TO THOSE OF OTHER HEALTHCARE COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”) AS THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM IT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE AS PRESENTED TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK.THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK AND BELOW. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 (THE “2015 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION, AND (4) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. ITEMS FALLING WITHIN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT’S “UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING” CLASSIFICATION MAY OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THESE ITEMS AND AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP, AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2015 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2015 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. EXCLUDING NET OPERATING REVENUES, THE COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON A GAAP BASIS BECAUSE IT IS UNABLE TO PREDICT, WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY, THE FUTURE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. SUCH ITEMS INCLUDE GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES-ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL, MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS), ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. THESE ITEMS ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, AND COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED EBITDA  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,(MILLIONS) 2016 2015 2016 2015 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES $152.2 $102.9 $311.9 $204.9 $484.8 $444.9 $470.3 $411.5 $342.7PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS (15.4) (10.9) (31.9) (22.5) (47.2) (31.6) (26.0) (27.0) (21.0)PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL 1.7 0.1 1.9 2.3 3.0 9.3 9.5 16.1 21.0INTEREST EXPENSE AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNTS AND FEES 43.4 30.9 88.0 62.7 142.9 109.2 100.4 94.1 119.4EQUITY IN NET INCOME OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES 2.4 2.3 4.8 3.9 8.7 10.7 11.2 12.7 12.0NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS (18.6) (17.3) (37.3) (33.8) (69.7) (59.7) (57.8) (50.9) (47.0)AMORTIZATION OF DEBT-RELATED ITEMS (3.4) (3.0) (6.8) (6.3) (14.3) (12.7) (5.0) (3.7) (4.2)DISTRIBUTIONS FROM NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (1.3) (1.8) (3.0) (3.7) (7.7) (12.6) (11.4) (11.0) (13.0)CURRENT PORTION OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE 4.0 3.4 9.0 6.9 14.8 13.3 6.3 5.9 0.6CHANGE IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 36.9 45.2 55.2 101.2 147.1 90.1 48.9 58.1 41.4NET PREMIUM PAID ON BOND ISSUANCE/REDEMPTION 2.0 11.8 3.9 3.8 3.9 4.3 1.7 1.9 22.8CASH USED IN (PROVIDED BY) OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 0.3 0.2 0.5 0.3 0.7 1.2 1.9 (2.0) (9.1)TRANSACTION COSTS — 3.3 — 3.3 12.3 9.3 — — —OTHER 0.1 2.4 0.2 2.6 3.2 1.9 1.6 0.2 0.6ADJUSTED EBITDA $204.3 $169.5 $396.4 $325.6 $682.5 $577.6 $551.6 $505.9 $466.2FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $66.0 MILLION AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2016, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, OR THE COMMITTEE, OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF PAREXEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, OR THE COMPANY, APPROVED TARGETS UNDER THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN, OR MIP, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2017, OR FISCAL YEAR 2017. UNDER THE MIP FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017, INCENTIVES OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DISCLOSED IN OUR PROXY STATEMENT, DATED OCTOBER 23, 2015 (THE “NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS”), ARE BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CORPORATE, BUSINESS UNIT AND PERSONAL GOALS. THE CORPORATE GOALS SET BY THE COMMITTEE INCLUDE SPECIFIC NET NEW BUSINESS AWARD, OR NBA, REVENUE GROWTH, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE, OR EPS, OBJECTIVES, AND THE BUSINESS UNIT OBJECTIVES ARE BASED ON ACHIEVING PREDETERMINED REVENUE, CONTROLLABLE PROFIT CONTRIBUTION, OR CPC, AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION OBJECTIVES. PERSONAL GOALS COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE 20% OF EACH EXECUTIVE'S FISCAL YEAR 2017 MIP OPPORTUNITY. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017, CORPORATE AND BUSINESS UNIT GOALS WERE SET TO HAVE A ROUGHLY 80% CHANCE OF ATTAINMENT BASED ON BUDGETS, MARKET CONDITIONS AND HISTORICAL FACTORS.

FOR EXECUTIVES TO BE AWARDED ANY PAYMENT UNDER THE NBA ELEMENT OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 MIP, GREATER THAN 95% OF THE TARGETED VALUE HAS TO BE ATTAINED. OVER-ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN GOALS ENABLES AN INDIVIDUAL TO EARN MORE THAN 100% OF THE TARGETED MIP. HOWEVER, TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH OVERACHIEVEMENT PAYMENT WOULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO MISS ITS TARGETS, THAT PAYMENT IS REDUCED. THE METRICS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 BONUS OPPORTUNITIES UNDER THE COMPANY'S MIP FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, EXCLUDING PERSONAL GOALS, ARE AS FOLLOWS: JOSEF VON RICKENBACH HAS A TARGET BONUS EQUAL TO 110% OF BASE SALARY AND CAN ACHIEVE A MAXIMUM BONUS OF 135.0% OF HIS TARGET BONUS (OR 148.5% OF HIS BASE SALARY), BASED UPON NBA, REVENUE GROWTH AND EPS METRICS; MARK A.

THE AMOUNTS AWARDED TO EACH OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WERE AS FOLLOWS: JOSEF VON RICKENBACH, $679,400; MARK GOLDBERG, $317,400; GADI SAARONY, $128,900; DOUGLAS BATT, $128,900.  EMMA REEVE WILL ALSO RECEIVE A CASH BONUS OF $54,107.NO BONUSES WERE PAID UNDER THE COMPANY'S MIP FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 BECAUSE THE COMPANY MISSED THE TARGET SET FOR OPERATING INCOME REQUIRED TO FUND THE MIP.  IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016, THE COMMITTEE TOOK A BROAD LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY GENERALLY AND MANAGEMENT SPECIFICALLY, INCLUDING THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE SHORTFALL IN ACHIEVEMENT OF OPERATING TARGETS RELATED TO THE MIP IN LIGHT OF THE GENERALLY STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS PER SHARE, BACKLOG, CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL, AND 3-YEAR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURNS.  AS A RESULT OF THIS REVIEW, THE COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT AWARDING A DISCRETIONARY BONUS WAS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY TO REINFORCE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED OPERATING MARGIN IMPROVEMENT, AS WELL AS RECOGNIZE THE EFFORT AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF KEY PERFORMERS. THE COMMITTEE CONCLUDED, HOWEVER, THAT THIS SPECIAL INCENTIVE NEEDED TO EXTEND BEYOND THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND INCLUDE THE LARGER MANAGEMENT TEAM IN ORDER TO HAVE THE INTENDED EFFECT.  THE DISCRETIONARY BONUSES WERE CALCULATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE EXTENT OF ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT AGAINST THE FISCAL YEAR 2016 MIP FINANCE AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER.  THE BONUS FOR DOUGLAS BATT WAS INCREASED TO RECOGNIZE HIS ACHIEVEMENT REGARDING ADVANCEMENT OF CORPORATE STRATEGIC GOALS DURING FISCAL YEAR 2016.",PRXL

ADDITION, FOLLOWING CERTAIN CORPORATE EVENTS THAT OCCUR PRIOR TO THE MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY WILL PAY A CASH MAKE-WHOLE PREMIUM BY INCREASING THE CONVERSION RATE FOR A HOLDER WHO ELECTS TO CONVERT ITS NOTES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH A CORPORATE
EVENT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE COMPANY MAY NOT REDEEM THE NOTES PRIOR TO THE MATURITY DATE, AND NO SINKING FUND IS PROVIDED FOR THE
NOTES.  IF THE COMPANY UNDERGOES A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE), HOLDERS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE FOR CASH
ALL OR PART OF THEIR NOTES AT A REPURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REPURCHASED, PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE REPURCHASE DATE.

SUBSIDIARIES.  THE NOTES WILL BE SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND WILL RANK SENIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ANY OF THE

AND THE FORM OF NOTES, WHICH ARE FILED AS EXHIBITS 4.1 AND 4.2 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K AND ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  THE CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS  IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRICING OF
THE NOTES, ON FEBRUARY 11, 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS RELATING TO A NOTIONAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE NOTES TO BE ISSUED BY THE
COMPANY (WITHOUT REGARD TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION) WITH TWO COUNTERPARTIES, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, LONDON BRANCH AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES). THE CASH
CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CASH PAYMENTS DUE UPON ANY CONVERSION OF THE NOTES. HOWEVER, THE WARRANT TRANSACTIONS COULD SEPARATELY HAVE A DILUTIVE EFFECT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE MARKET VALUE PER SHARE OF THE
COMPANYS COMMON STOCK (AS MEASURED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE WARRANT TRANSACTIONS) EXCEEDS THE APPLICABLE STRIKE PRICE OF THE WARRANTS. THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE WARRANTS WILL INITIALLY BE $53.8475 PER SHARE, WHICH IS 75% ABOVE THE LAST REPORTED
SALE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON FEBRUARY 11, 2013.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXERCISE IN FULL BY THE INITIAL PURCHASERS OF THEIR OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION IN RESPECT
OF THE NOTES, ON FEBRUARY 13, 2013, THE COMPANY AND THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES AMENDED THE CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO ON FEBRUARY 11, 2013 TO UPSIZE SUCH TRANSACTIONS BY A NOTIONAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF
THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK CORRESPONDING TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES UNDERLYING THE NOTES PURCHASED PURSUANT TO THE EXERCISE OF SUCH OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2013, THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL WARRANT TRANSACTIONS
WITH THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES RELATING TO A NUMBER OF SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK CORRESPONDING TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES UNDERLYING THE NOTES PURCHASED PURSUANT TO THE EXERCISE OF SUCH OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION. EACH OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE CASH
CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS AND THE ADDITIONAL WARRANT TRANSACTIONS WERE ON SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TERMS TO THE CORRESPONDING TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO ON FEBRUARY 11, 2013.  THE COMPANY USED APPROXIMATELY $74.3 MILLION OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING TO PAY THE COST OF THE CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS (AFTER SUCH COST WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PROCEEDS TO
THE COMPANY FROM THE SALE OF WARRANTS IN THE WARRANT TRANSACTIONS AND THE ADDITIONAL WARRANT TRANSACTIONS).  ASIDE FROM
THE INITIAL PAYMENT OF A PREMIUM TO THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES OF APPROXIMATELY $149.3 MILLION, THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY CASH PAYMENTS TO THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES UNDER THE CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS AND WILL BE
ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FROM THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES AN AMOUNT OF CASH, GENERALLY EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK EXCEEDS THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS DURING THE RELEVANT
VALUATION PERIOD. THE STRIKE PRICE UNDER THE CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS IS INITIALLY EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE NOTES. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE MARKET VALUE PER SHARE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK EXCEEDS THE STRIKE PRICE OF
THE WARRANTS ON ANY TRADING DAY DURING THE 160 TRADING DAY MEASUREMENT PERIOD UNDER THE WARRANT TRANSACTIONS AND THE ADDITIONAL WARRANT TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY WILL BE OBLIGATED TO ISSUE TO THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES A NUMBER OF SHARES EQUAL IN
VALUE TO THE PRODUCT OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH SUCH MARKET VALUE EXCEEDS SUCH STRIKE PRICE AND 1/160TH OF THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE WARRANT TRANSACTIONS AND THE ADDITIONAL WARRANT TRANSACTIONS, SUBJECT TO A SHARE DELIVERY CAP. THE COMPANY WILL NOT
RECEIVE ANY ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS IF WARRANTS ARE EXERCISED.  THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTION OF THE CASH CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS, WARRANT
TRANSACTIONS AND ADDITIONAL WARRANT TRANSACTIONS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE CALL OPTION TRANSACTION CONFIRMATIONS RELATING TO THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS (AND THE RELATED AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE), THE BASE
WARRANT CONFIRMATIONS RELATING TO THE WARRANT TRANSACTIONS AND THE ADDITIONAL WARRANT CONFIRMATIONS RELATING TO THE ADDITIONAL WARRANT TRANSACTIONS WITH EACH OF THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH ARE FILED AS EXHIBITS 10.1 THROUGH 10.8 TO THIS CURRENT

0.50% PER ANNUM AND (III) THE EURODOLLAR RATE (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE APPLICABLE MARGIN) FOR A ONE MONTH INTEREST PERIOD ON SUCH DAY (OR IF SUCH DAY IS NOT A BUSINESS DAY, THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING BUSINESS DAY) PLUS 1.00%. THE
EURODOLLAR RATE IS A RESERVE ADJUSTED RATE AT WHICH EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS ARE OFFERED IN THE INTERBANK EURODOLLAR MARKET PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN. IN ADDITION TO INTEREST PAYABLE ON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING FROM TIME TO TIME
UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO PAY A QUARTERLY COMMITMENT FEE OF 0.25% TO 0.50% (BASED UPON THE COMPANYS LEVERAGE RATIO) OF THE UNUSED AMOUNT OF THE LENDERS COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE APPLICABLE
MARGINS RANGED BETWEEN 0.75% TO 1.75% FOR BASE RATE LOANS AND 1.75% TO 2.75% FOR EURODOLLAR LOANS, IN EACH CASE, BASED UPON THE COMPANYS LEVERAGE RATIO.

TRANSACTIONS AND ADDITIONAL WARRANT TRANSACTIONS, RESPECTIVELY, WITH EACH OF THE TWO OPTION COUNTERPARTIES. PURSUANT TO THESE WARRANT TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY ISSUED 1,152,802 WARRANTS WITH A STRIKE PRICE OF $53.8475 PER SHARE. THE NUMBER OF
WARRANTS AND THE STRIKE PRICE ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE BASE WARRANTS CONFIRMATIONS AND THE ADDITIONAL WARRANT CONFIRMATIONS. THE COMPANY OFFERED AND SOLD THE WARRANTS IN RELIANCE ON THE EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY SECTION 4(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT. NEITHER THE WARRANTS NOR THE UNDERLYING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (ISSUABLE IN THE EVENT THE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF THE COMMON STOCK EXCEEDS THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE WARRANTS ON THE
DATE THE WARRANTS ARE EXERCISED) HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. NEITHER THE WARRANTS NOR SUCH UNDERLYING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK MAY BE OFFERED OR SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES ABSENT REGISTRATION OR AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION FROM

UNDER THE 2013 BONUS PLAN, AS LONG AS THE COMPANY'S 2013 SALES REVENUE IS ABOVE THE THRESHOLD LEVEL ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE, EACH OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A CASH BONUS.  IF THE COMPANY ACHIEVES THE TARGET LEVEL OF 2013 SALES REVENUE, EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE HIS TARGET BONUS.  IF THE COMPANY EXCEEDS THE 2013 SALES REVENUE TARGET, EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A TARGET BONUS ADJUSTED BASED ON A SCALE THAT ESTABLISHES BONUS MULTIPLIERS FOR 2013 SALES REVENUES AT VARIOUS SPECIFIED LEVELS.  AFTER DETERMINING THE COMPANY'S 2013 SALES REVENUE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF THE CASH BONUS WILL BE CALCULATED BY MULTIPLYING THE APPROPRIATE BONUS MULTIPLIER BY EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S TARGET BONUS, WHICH, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF MR. BARON, IS THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S ACTUAL CASH BONUS PAID PURSUANT TO THE 2012 BONUS PLAN.  MR. BARON'S TARGET BONUS IS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF HIS CASH BONUS AWARDED PURSUANT TO THE 2012 BONUS PLAN, LESS A $100,000 DISCRETIONARY INCREASE GRANTED BY THE COMMITTEE FOR MR. BARON UNDER THE 2012 BONUS PLAN.  USING THIS FORMULA, A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S ACTUAL CASH BONUS MAY BE LESS THAN HIS TARGET BONUS, DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S 2013 SALES REVENUE.  FOLLOWING THIS MATHEMATICAL COMPUTATION, THE COMMITTEE HAS THE DISCRETION TO APPLY AN INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE MODIFIER TO INCREASE OR DECREASE ANY NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S ANNUAL EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE BONUS PAYMENT, BASED ON THE COMMITTEE'S EVALUATION OF INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, THERE WERE “REPORTABLE EVENTS” (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN ITEM 304(A)(1)(V) OF REGULATION S-K).

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE WITH E&Y AND HAS AUTHORIZED E&Y TO RESPOND FULLY TO THE INQUIRIES OF KPMG LLP (“KPMG”), THE COMPANY’S NEWLY APPOINTED INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, CONCERNING SUCH MATERIAL WEAKNESSES AND ANY OTHER MATTERS.

AS DISCLOSED PREVIOUSLY, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012 INCLUDE A ONE-TIME BONUS OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION IN LIEU OF OCTOBER 1, 2012 MERIT INCREASES FOR ALL NON-MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. A 2.25% MERIT INCREASE WOULD HAVE AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $5.5 MILLION IN SALARIES AND BENEFITS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012.

ADJUSTED EBITDA GUIDANCE FOR 2012 HAS BEEN INCREASED FROM A RANGE OF $490 MILLION TO $495 MILLION TO A RANGE OF $495 MILLION TO $498 MILLION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE PRESENTED USING INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH.DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF THE COMPANY'S DELEVERING AND REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS IN 2012 AND THE IMPACT OF SEQUESTRATION BEGINNING IN MARCH 2013, THE COMPANY ALSO WILL ADJUST ITS BUSINESS MODEL FOR 2013 THROUGH 2015. THIS BUSINESS MODEL INCLUDES A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE FOR ADJUSTED EBITDA THAT CHANGED FROM A RANGE OF 5% TO 8% TO A RANGE OF 4% TO 8% AND A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE FOR ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW THAT CHANGED FROM A RANGE OF 12% TO 17% TO A RANGE OF 10% TO 14%. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL SHARE ITS PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW FOR 2012 AND ITS PRELIMINARY ASSUMPTIONS AROUND FREE CASH FLOW FOR 2013 IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES. THESE CONSIDERATIONS AROUND ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:CERTAIN CASH FLOW ITEMS2013 ASSUMPTIONS2012 ESTIMATES2011 ACTUALS (IN MILLIONS)CASH INTEREST EXPENSE$90 TO $95$90$115.2CASH PAYMENTS FOR TAXES$8 TO $12$8 TO $12$9.1WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER$10 TO $20$25 TO $35$10.6    MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES$85 TO $90$85$50.8NET CASH SWAP-RELATED SETTLEMENTS ——$10.9DIVIDENDS PAID ON PREFERRED STOCK$23$25$26.0THE COMPANY WILL ALSO DISCUSS ITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEPLOYING ITS FREE CASH FLOWS.

ALSO, 2012 INCLUDES AN INITIAL INVESTMENT FOR A REPLACEMENT HOSPITAL FOR THE COMPANY'S CURRENTLY LEASED HOSPITAL IN LUDLOW, MASSACHUSETTS. THE COMPANY USES “SAME-STORE” COMPARISONS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS AND LINE ITEMS WITHIN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT PERIODS AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 HERETO INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 (THE “2011 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY'S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 21, SETTLEMENTS, AND NOTE 22, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2011 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 9, CONTINGENCIES, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012 (THE ""SEPTEMBER 2012 FORM 10-Q""), AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT INCREASING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE FOLLOWING ITEMS: (1) NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, (2) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (3) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (4) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2011 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT AND PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY'S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2011 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2012 FORM 10-Q FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ""LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,"" AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 (THE “2012 FORM 10‑K”), WHEN FILED. THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NON‑COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY'S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE 2012 FORM 10‑K, WHEN FILED, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT INCREASING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP""), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT AND PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A  RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY'S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT PERIODS AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS.

THESE HOSPITALS PROCESS ALL OF THEIR MEDICARE CLAIMS THROUGH THE SAME MEDICARE ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRACTOR, CAHABA GOVERNMENT BENEFIT ADMINISTRATORS, LLC. EACH SUBPOENA IS IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGED IMPROPER OR FRAUDULENT CLAIMS SUBMITTED TO MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND REQUESTS DOCUMENTS AND MATERIALS RELATING TO PRACTICES, PROCEDURES, PROTOCOLS AND POLICIES, OF CERTAIN PRE- AND POST-ADMISSIONS ACTIVITIES AT THESE HOSPITALS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MARKETING FUNCTIONS, PRE-ADMISSION SCREENING, POST-ADMISSION PHYSICIAN EVALUATIONS, PATIENT ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS, INDIVIDUALIZED PATIENT PLANS OF CARE, AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE MEDICARE 60% RULE. UNDER THE MEDICARE RULE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE “60% RULE,” AN INPATIENT REHABILITATION HOSPITAL MUST TREAT 60% OR MORE OF ITS PATIENTS FROM AT LEAST ONE OF A SPECIFIED LIST OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO BE REIMBURSED AT THE INPATIENT REHABILITATION HOSPITAL PAYMENT RATES, RATHER THAN AT THE LOWER ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL PAYMENT RATES. THE SUBPOENAS ALSO REQUEST COMPLETE COPIES OF MEDICAL RECORDS FOR 100 PATIENTS TREATED AT EACH OF THESE HOSPITALS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2008 AND JUNE 2012.IN 2009, THE UNITED STATES CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES ISSUED NEW COVERAGE RULES AND COVERAGE CRITERIA APPLICABLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT AS AN INPATIENT REHABILITATION HOSPITAL THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2010.

HEALTHSOUTH, IN ADVANCE OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE NEW COVERAGE RULES AND COVERAGE CRITERIA, UNDERTOOK EFFORTS TO PUBLISH AN EXTENSIVE COMPLIANCE GUIDE AND TO INSTITUTE A STANDARDIZED, COMPANY-WIDE TRAINING PROGRAM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE NEW COVERAGE RULES AND CRITERIA. HEALTHSOUTH ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT ON-GOING TRAINING AND EDUCATION REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH THESE RULES AND CRITERIA. ALTHOUGH HEALTHSOUTH DOES NOT KNOW THE ORIGIN OF THIS INVESTIGATION, THE HHS-OIG ISSUED IN 2012 A WORK PLAN FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013, A SUMMARY OF NEW AND ONGOING HHS-OIG REVIEW ACTIVITIES, THAT IDENTIFIED AREAS OF FOCUS IN THE INPATIENT REHABILITATION INDUSTRY, INCLUDING PROPER DOCUMENTATION OF PRE-ADMISSION SCREENING AND POST-ADMISSION PHYSICIAN EVALUATIONS AND TIMELY SUBMISSION OF PATIENT ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS.HEALTHSOUTH IS COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE HHS-OIG IN CONNECTION WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND IS CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PREDICT THE TIMING OR OUTCOME OF THIS INVESTIGATION.

AMOUNT IN AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY, BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE ON FEBRUARY 19, 2013, AND REFLECTING THE 10:1 RATIO BETWEEN CDIS AND NYSE SHARES. BECAUSE THE TWO EXCHANGES HAVE DIFFERENT SETTLEMENT AND TRANSFER PROCEDURES, THE EX-DIVIDEND PERIODS

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 2.02 OF FORM 8‑K, “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION,” AND ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, (THE “SECURITIES ACT”) OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.ON APRIL 25, 2013, HEALTHSOUTH CORPORATION (THE “COMPANY”) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE REPORTING THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013. A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. SEE ITEM 2.02, “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION,” ABOVE.IN ADDITION, A COPY OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED DURING THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS CALL AT 9:00 A.M. EASTERN TIME ON FRIDAY, APRIL 26, 2013 IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ""LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,"" AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 (THE “2012 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY'S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 9, CONTINGENCIES, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 (THE ""MARCH 2013 FORM 10-Q""), WHEN FILED, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP""), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT AND PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A  RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY'S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT PERIODS AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN  ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 (THE “2012 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT.

CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 9, CONTINGENCIES, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 (THE “MARCH 2013 FORM 10-Q”), AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT AND PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1.

HEALTHSOUTH PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, JAY GRINNEY, WILL PARTICIPATE IN A FIRESIDE CHAT PRESENTATION ON WEDNESDAY, JUNE 19TH AT 8:20 A.M. ET AND REFERENCE SELECTED SLIDES PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 (THE “INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK”) TO THE CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8‑K DATED MAY 17, 2013. THE PRESENTATION WILL ADDRESS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND DISCUSS INDUSTRY TRENDS AND DYNAMICS. THE PRESENTATION WILL BE WEBCAST LIVE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM BY CLICKING ON AN AVAILABLE LINK.THE COMPANY WILL PROVIDE ITS OBSERVATION THAT IT EXPERIENCED SOLID DISCHARGE GROWTH FOR APRIL AND MAY OF 2013. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO REITERATE ITS 2013 GUIDANCE, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN THE CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K DATED MAY 17, 2013 AND APRIL 25, 2013 AND DURING THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL HELD ON APRIL 26, 2013. THAT IS, THE COMPANY STILL EXPECTS TO BE AT THE HIGH END OF, OR GREATER THAN, THE FOLLOWING RANGES:•ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $506 TO $516 MILLION; AND•EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH OF $1.61 TO $1.68.AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE EPS GUIDANCE ABOVE REFLECTS THE HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE AND LOWER SHARE COUNT AS A RESULT OF THE PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY 9.1 MILLION SHARES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013 THROUGH A TENDER OFFER BUT DOES NOT REFLECT THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF AT LEAST $1.03 PER BASIC SHARE ($0.90 PER DILUTED SHARE) AS A RESULT OF AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH THE IRS IN LATE APRIL.IN ADDITION, UNDERLYING THE GUIDANCE ABOVE ARE THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE PERIOD OF APRIL THROUGH DECEMBER 2013:•DISCHARGE GROWTH OF BETWEEN 3% AND 4% (INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF WALTON REHABILITATION HOSPITAL ON APRIL 1, 2013); •REVENUE PER DISCHARGE GROWTH OF BETWEEN 2.3% AND 2.6%;•REVENUE GROWTH BEFORE SEQUESTRATION OF BETWEEN 4.9% AND 6.2%; •SEQUESTRATION IMPACT OF DECREASE IN NET OPERATING REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $28 MILLION AND DECREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA OF APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION; AND•OPERATING EXPENSES, AS A PERCENT OF NET OPERATING REVENUES, GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH, OR IN SOME CASES LOWER THAN, THE FINAL THREE QUARTERS OF 2012.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN  ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 (THE “2012 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 9, CONTINGENCIES, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 (THE “MARCH 2013 FORM 10-Q”), AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT AND PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2012 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE MARCH 2013 FORM 10-Q FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED EBITDA THREE MONTHS ENDED           MARCH 31, YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 2012 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 (IN MILLIONS)NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES$121.4 $81.0 $411.5 $342.7 $331.0 $406.1 $227.2PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS(7.4) (6.3) (27.0) (21.0) (16.4) (30.7) (23.0)PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL1.4 3.6 16.1 21.0 17.2 8.8 44.4INTEREST EXPENSE AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT             DISCOUNTS AND FEES24.2 23.3 94.1 119.4 125.6 125.7 159.3UBS SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS, GROSS— — — — — (100.0) —EQUITY IN NET INCOME OF NONCONSOLIDATED             AFFILIATES2.9 3.3 12.7 12.0 10.1 4.6 10.6NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS             IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS(14.6) (12.6) (50.9) (47.0) (40.9) (33.3) (29.8)AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNTS AND FEES(1.0) (0.9) (3.7) (4.2) (6.3) (6.6) (6.5)DISTRIBUTIONS FROM NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES(3.4) (3.3) (11.0) (13.0) (8.1) (8.6) (10.9)CURRENT PORTION OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)1.8 2.1 5.9 0.6 2.9 (7.0) (72.8)CHANGE IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES13.0 36.9 60.7 49.9 2.8 (2.1) 50.6NET PREMIUM PAID ON BOND ISSUANCE/REDEMPTION— — 1.9 22.8 — — —CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION,             AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS LIABILITY— — (2.6) (8.5) 2.9 11.2 7.4CASH USED IN (PROVIDED BY) OPERATING ACTIVITIES             OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS0.7 (0.4) (2.0) (9.1) (13.2) (5.7) (32.5)OTHER0.3 0.3 0.2 0.6 2.0 1.3 (1.4)ADJUSTED EBITDA$139.3 $127.0 $505.9 $466.2 $409.6 $363.7 $322.6FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $47.9 MILLION AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY.

PURSUANT TO THE VOTING AGREEMENT, EACH VOTING STOCKHOLDER GRANTED AKORN (OR ANY SENIOR EXECUTIVE OFFICER THEREOF) AN IRREVOCABLE PROXY AND POWER-OF-ATTORNEY TO VOTE THEIR SHARES OR EXECUTE WRITTEN CONSENTS IN RESPECT OF THEIR SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER AND THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. SEE ITEM 2.02, “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION,” ABOVE.IN ADDITION, A COPY OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED DURING THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS CALL AT 9:00 A.M. EASTERN TIME ON FRIDAY, JULY 26, 2013 IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ""LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,"" AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 (THE “2012 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY'S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 10, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 (THE ""JUNE 2013 FORM 10-Q""), WHEN FILED, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP""), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY'S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY WILL ALSO REITERATE ITS 2013 GUIDANCE, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN THE CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K DATED AUGUST 12, 2013 AND JULY 25, 2013 AND DURING THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL HELD ON JULY 26, 2013. THAT IS, THE COMPANY STILL EXPECTS TO BE WITHIN THE FOLLOWING RANGES:•ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $520 TO $530 MILLION; AND•EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH OF $2.87 TO $2.93.AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE EPS GUIDANCE ABOVE REFLECTS THE HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE AND LOWER SHARE COUNT AS A RESULT OF THE PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY 9.1 MILLION SHARES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013 THROUGH A TENDER OFFER AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $115 MILLION AS A RESULT OF AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH THE IRS ON APRIL 25, 2013.IN ADDITION, UNDERLYING THE GUIDANCE ABOVE ARE THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE PERIOD OF JULY THROUGH DECEMBER 2013:•REVENUE GROWTH BEFORE SEQUESTRATION OF BETWEEN 5.0% AND 6.0%; ▪DISCHARGE GROWTH OF BETWEEN 3.0% AND 4.0%;▪REVENUE PER DISCHARGE GROWTH BEFORE SEQUESTRATION OF BETWEEN 2.3% AND 2.6%;•ADJUSTED EBITDA REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION, NET OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, FOR SEQUESTRATION;•A PLANNED MERIT INCREASE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013;•INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION DUE TO CONTINUED INSTALLATION OF NEW CLINICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM; AND•HIGHER NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS EXPENSE OF $3 MILLION DUE TO CHANGES AT TWO JOINT VENTURES.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 (THE “2012 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 10, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 (THE “JUNE 2013 FORM 10-Q”), AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.  THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) IS
CURRENTLY TRANSITIONING FROM ICD-9 TO ICD-10 CODES, SCHEDULED FOR IMPLEMENTATION ON OCTOBER 1, 2014. ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2013, AN ICD-9-CM COORDINATION AND MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE MEETING WAS HELD BY CMS TO DISCUSS THE COORDINATION
AND MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES (ICD-9 AND ICD-10) CODES THAT ARE USED IN ALL HOSPITAL PROCEDURES.   


1.
CMS INTENT FOR ICD-10 IS TO BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE, NOT TO CHANGE DRG MAPPING OR PAYMENT: BASED UPON INITIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH CMS, THE PROPOSED CODE CHANGES ARE ONE ELEMENT OF THE CMS PROCESS FOR THE TRANSITION TO
ICD-10, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE SPECIFICITY AND ACCURACY OF CODING LANGUAGE (AND IS NOT UNIQUE TO IMPELLA®). FURTHERMORE, CMS HAS COMMUNICATED THAT THE TRANSITION TO ICD-10 CODES IS
NOT INTENDED TO RESULT IN DRG MAPPING CHANGES OR PAYMENT. STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR DRG ASSIGNMENT INVOLVES EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF COST DATA, NOT A CHANGE IN DESCRIPTION. 
 


2.
NEW ICD-10 CODE DESCRIPTIONS ARE A PROPOSAL BY CMS. THE CODE DESCRIPTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AN OPEN COMMENT PERIOD THROUGH NOVEMBER 15, 2013. IF APPROVED, THE PROPOSED ICD-10 CODE DESCRIPTIONS WOULD BECOME
EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 1, 2014.   


3.
ICD-9/ICD-10 CODE MAPPING TO DRGS: CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS FOR IMPELLA ARE BASED UPON MULTIPLE ICD-9 CODES, INCLUDING PROCEDURE AND DIAGNOSIS CODES DESCRIBING THE CLINICAL SCENARIO AND THERAPEUTIC USE OF THE
MEDICAL DEVICE. THESE COMBINED CODES MOST FREQUENTLY RESULT IN ASSIGNMENT TO DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS (DRGS) 216, 217, AND 218 FOR IMPELLA PRODUCTS. 
THE PROPOSED ICD-10 CODES MAY ALSO RESULT IN ASSIGNMENT TO DRGS 228, 229, OR 230, ALONG WITH CURRENT DRGS. DRG 228, OTHER CARDIOTHORACIC
PROCEDURES WITH MAJOR CO-MORBIDITIES AND COMPLEXITIES, MOST CLOSELY ALIGNS WITH TYPICAL IMPELLA PATIENT PROFILES AND HAS AVERAGE PAYMENT WITHIN THE CURRENT RANGE OF IMPELLA REIMBURSEMENT. 
WE ALSO NOTE THAT IMPELLA HAS BEEN PROVEN AS COST-EFFECTIVE IN SEVERAL PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS, BOTH ON AN INCREMENTAL COST EFFECTIVENESS
RATIO BASIS AS WELL AS IN A BUDGET IMPACT MODEL, AND THAT OTHER HEMODYNAMIC SUPPORT DEVICES, INCLUDING EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE OXYGENATION (ECMO), EXTRACORPOREAL VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICES, AND IMPLANTABLE LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICES, ALL
CURRENTLY ARE REIMBURSED AT HIGHER DRG LEVELS.  THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ITEM 7.01 SHALL NOT BE DEEMED FILED FOR
PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 OR OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO THE LIABILITIES OF THAT SECTION, NOR SHALL IT BE DEEMED INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR THE SECURITIES ACT OF

 ON AUGUST 1, 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED AN INCREASE IN THE CASH DIVIDEND TO US $0.25 PER
SHARE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. THE DIVIDEND WILL BE PAYABLE ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2013, WITH A RECORD DATE OF AUGUST 20, 2013. WE WILL PAY THE DIVIDEND IN US CURRENCY TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK TRADING ON THE NEW YORK STOCK
EXCHANGE (NYSE). WE WILL PAY THE DIVIDEND TO HOLDERS OF CHESS DEPOSITARY INSTRUMENTS (CDIS) TRADING ON THE AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE (ASX) AT AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IN AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY, BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE ON AUGUST 20, 2013,
AND REFLECTING THE 10:1 RATIO BETWEEN CDIS AND NYSE SHARES. BECAUSE THE TWO EXCHANGES HAVE DIFFERENT SETTLEMENT AND TRANSFER PROCEDURES, THE EX-DIVIDEND PERIODS BEFORE THE RECORD DATE WILL BE DIFFERENT FOR COMMON STOCK AND FOR CDIS. THE
EX-DIVIDEND DATE WILL BE AUGUST 14, 2013 FOR CDI HOLDERS AND AUGUST 16, 2013 FOR COMMON STOCK HOLDERS. AS A RESULT OF THESE DIFFERENCES, WE HAVE RECEIVED A WAIVER FROM THE ASXS SETTLEMENT OPERATING RULES, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO DEFER
PROCESSING CONVERSIONS BETWEEN ITS COMMON STOCK AND CDI REGISTERS FROM AUGUST 14, 2013 THROUGH AUGUST 20, 2013, INCLUSIVE.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  ON JULY 31, 2013, TELEFLEX INCORPORATED (THE COMPANY) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE (THE PRESS RELEASE) ANNOUNCING ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2013. A
COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT.  IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (GAAP), THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED
DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH. ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARES EXCLUDES, DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD PRESENTED, (I) THE EFFECT OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, AS WELL AS GOODWILL AND
OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (II) THE GAIN OR LOSS ON SALES OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS; (III) LOSSES AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO ACQUISITION COSTS, THE REVERSAL OF A RESERVE ASSOCIATED WITH A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED STOCK KEEPING UNIT
REDUCTION PROGRAM, AND A LITIGATION VERDICT AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO A NON-OPERATING JOINT VENTURE; (IV) THE AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT DISCOUNT ON THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES; (V) CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMORTIZATION
OF ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP TERMINATED IN 2011; (VI) INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE; AND (VII) TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEARS TAX MATTERS AND THE FILING OF PRIOR
YEARS AMENDED TAX RETURNS. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED SHARES WITHIN ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GIVES EFFECT TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS, WHICH REDUCE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC
DILUTION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD OCCUR UPON CONVERSION OF THE COMPANYS SENIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE NOTES (UNDER GAAP, THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTED IN DILUTED SHARES). THE COMPANY HAS
DECIDED TO INCLUDE THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS BECAUSE IT BELIEVES IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ECONOMIC EFFECTS. CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE AND GROWTH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING THE
RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AT DIFFERENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. 
MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE MEASURES ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY ELIMINATE ITEMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT TELEFLEXS DAY-TO-DAY
OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE
NOTES. MANAGEMENT USES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, WHEN PUBLICLY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATION OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. HOWEVER, SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS PRESENTED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED
MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  THE INFORMATION FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 2.02 OF THIS CURRENT REPORT, INCLUDING
EXHIBIT 99.1 HERETO, SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED FILED FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, OR OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO THE LIABILITY OF SUCH SECTION, NOR SHALL IT BE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO

A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.

EASTERN TIME ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2013 IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ""LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,"" AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 (THE “2012 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY'S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 10, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2013 (THE ""SEPTEMBER 2013 FORM 10-Q""), WHEN FILED, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP""), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY'S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM BY CLICKING ON AN AVAILABLE LINK.AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, THE COMPANY REITERATES ITS ADJUSTED EBITDA GUIDANCE AND REVISES ITS EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE FOR 2013, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE FURNISHED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THE CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K DATED OCTOBER 28, 2013 AND DURING THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL HELD ON OCTOBER 29, 2013. THE EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE HAS BEEN REVISED SOLELY TO INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THE EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS. EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE FOR 2013 HAS BEEN ADJUSTED FROM A RANGE OF $3.06 TO $3.09 PER DILUTED SHARE TO A RANGE OF $2.43 TO $2.46 PER BASIC SHARE. EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE PRESENTED USING INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH.THE COMPANY USES “SAME-STORE” COMPARISONS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS AND LINE ITEMS WITHIN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT PERIODS AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ITEM 7.01 IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN  ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 (THE “2012 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 10, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2013 (THE “SEPTEMBER 2013 FORM 10-Q”), AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

ON OCTOBER 24, 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF US $0.25 PER SHARE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON
STOCK. THE DIVIDEND WILL BE PAYABLE ON DECEMBER 18, 2013, WITH A RECORD DATE OF NOVEMBER 19, 2013. WE WILL PAY THE DIVIDEND IN US CURRENCY TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK TRADING ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NYSE). WE WILL PAY
THE DIVIDEND TO HOLDERS OF CHESS DEPOSITARY INSTRUMENTS (CDIS) TRADING ON THE AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE (ASX) AT AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IN AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY, BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE ON NOVEMBER 19, 2013, AND REFLECTING THE 10:1 RATIO
BETWEEN CDIS AND NYSE SHARES. BECAUSE THE TWO EXCHANGES HAVE DIFFERENT SETTLEMENT AND TRANSFER PROCEDURES, THE EX-DIVIDEND PERIODS BEFORE THE RECORD DATE WILL BE DIFFERENT FOR COMMON STOCK AND FOR CDIS. THE EX-DIVIDEND DATE WILL BE
NOVEMBER 13, 2013 FOR CDI HOLDERS AND NOVEMBER 15, 2013 FOR COMMON STOCK HOLDERS. AS A RESULT OF THESE DIFFERENCES, WE HAVE RECEIVED A WAIVER FROM THE ASXS SETTLEMENT OPERATING RULES, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO DEFER PROCESSING

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  ON OCTOBER 30, 2013, TELEFLEX
INCORPORATED (THE COMPANY) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE (THE PRESS RELEASE) ANNOUNCING ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2013. A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS CURRENT
REPORT.  IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (GAAP), THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH. ADJUSTED DILUTED
EARNINGS PER SHARES EXCLUDES, DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD PRESENTED (I) THE EFFECT OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, AS WELL AS GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (II) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT;
(III) THE GAIN OR LOSS ON SALES OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS; (IV) LOSSES AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO ACQUISITION COSTS, THE REVERSAL OF RESERVES RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES AND A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED STOCK KEEPING
UNIT RATIONALIZATION PROGRAM, AND A LITIGATION VERDICT AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO A NON-OPERATING JOINT VENTURE; (V) THE AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT DISCOUNT ON THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES; (VI) CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE
AMORTIZATION OF ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP TERMINATED IN 2011; (VII) INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE; AND (VIII) TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEARS TAX MATTERS AND THE FILING
OF PRIOR YEARS AMENDED TAX RETURNS. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED SHARES WITHIN ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GIVES EFFECT TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS, WHICH REDUCE THE POTENTIAL
ECONOMIC DILUTION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD OCCUR UPON CONVERSION OF THE COMPANYS SENIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE NOTES (UNDER GAAP, THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTED IN DILUTED SHARES). CONSTANT
CURRENCY REVENUE AND GROWTH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING THE RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AT DIFFERENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO
THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE MEASURES ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY ELIMINATE
ITEMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT TELEFLEXS DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE
CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. MANAGEMENT USES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, WHEN PUBLICLY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATION OF
PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. HOWEVER, SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS
PRESENTED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  THE INFORMATION FURNISHED

AS REPORTED ON JANUARY 13, 2014, THE COMPANY EXPECTS A RETROACTIVE RATE REDUCTION AT ITS WASHINGTON HEALTH PLAN TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS PRE-TAX
INCOME FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013 BY APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THIS RETROACTIVE RATE REDUCTION WILL REDUCE NET INCOME PER SHARE FOR THE QUARTER AND THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 BY APPROXIMATELY $0.20. 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE COMPANY NOW EXPECTS ITS NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $0.95. THE
COMPANY HAD PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, IT EXPECTED NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1.15.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE COMPANY NOW EXPECTS ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE, CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3.11. THE
COMPANY HAD PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, IT EXPECTED ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE, CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3.20. 
THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE, CONTINUING OPERATIONS, AS A SUPPLEMENTAL METRIC IN EVALUATING ITS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, MAKING
FINANCING AND BUSINESS DECISIONS, AND FORECASTING AND PLANNING FOR FUTURE PERIODS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE, AND WHEN COMPARING THE COMPANYS
PERFORMANCE WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND NOT AS SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, GAAP MEASURES. 
THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES ESTIMATED NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE, CONTINUING OPERATIONS, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP
MEASURE, TO ESTIMATED ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE, CONTINUING OPERATIONS. ALL AMOUNTS IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE ARE UNAUDITED ESTIMATES.

REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.  THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF ITS EFFORTS TO OBTAIN
FULL REIMBURSEMENT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (ACA) ANNUAL FEE, INCLUDING A GROSS-UP PAYMENT FOR THE ASSOCIATED TAX EFFECTS. THE TABLE ATTACHED HERETO AND FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT STATUS OF OUR EFFORTS TO OBTAIN CONTRACTUAL
COMMITMENTS TO FULL REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE OUR HEALTH PLANS.  SINCE OUR INVESTOR DAY CONFERENCE ON
FEBRUARY 13, 2014, WHEN WE LAST PROVIDED A STATUS UPDATE, AND AS REFLECTED IN THE COMMENTS COLUMN OF THE ATTACHED TABLE, THERE HAVE BEEN FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE STATES OF OHIO, CALIFORNIA, NEW MEXICO, ILLINOIS, AND FLORIDA. WE CURRENTLY
EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE TAX, PLUS A GROSS UP, IN THE STATES OF WASHINGTON AND WISCONSIN DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014. WITH REGARD TO ALL OTHER STATES, WE REMAIN UNCERTAIN AS TO WHEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO
RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE ACA ANNUAL FEE AND ASSOCIATED TAX EFFECTS. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY BE REIMBURSED FOR THE ACA ANNUAL FEE AND THE ASSOCIATED TAX EFFECTS, THE CURRENT LACK OF CONTRACTUAL
COMMITMENTS FROM THE MAJORITY OF STATES IN WHICH WE OPERATE OUR HEALTH PLANS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FIRST QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE COMPANY'S SHARE COUNT REFLECTS THE REPURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY 9.1 MILLION SHARES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013 THROUGH A TENDER OFFER.

THESE CONSIDERATIONS AROUND ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:CERTAIN CASH FLOW ITEMS2012 ACTUALS2013 ESTIMATES2014 ASSUMPTIONS (IN MILLIONS) CASH INTEREST EXPENSE$90.4$95$100CASH PAYMENTS FOR TAXES, NET OF REFUNDS$11.8$7$10 TO $15WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER$28.2$5 TO $15$10 TO $20    MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES$83.0$87$80 TO $90DIVIDENDS PAID ON PREFERRED STOCK$24.6$23$6WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE STRONG FREE CASH FLOW, THE POTENTIAL DEPLETION OF THE COMPANY'S FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS DURING THE 2014 TO 2016 TIMEFRAME WILL AFFECT ITS COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE FOR FREE CASH FLOW.THE COMPANY WILL ALSO DISCUSS ITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEPLOYING ITS FREE CASH FLOWS. WHILE THE COMPANY'S FREE CASH FLOW DEPLOYMENT PRIORITIES MAY SHIFT BASED ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY'S GROWTH, DEBT REDUCTION, AND SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 2012 ACTUALS2013 ESTIMATES2014 ASSUMPTIONSGROWTH IN CORE BUSINESS   BED EXPANSIONS (TARGET APPROXIMATELY 80 BEDS/YEAR) AND UNIT CONSOLIDATIONS$16.6$25$20 TO $30NEW IRF'S (TARGET 4-6/YEAR)41.15645 TO 75 $57.7$81$65 TO $105,EXCLUDINGACQUISITIONSDEBT REDUCTION   DEBT PAY DOWN, NET (1)—$(257)N/APURCHASE LEASED PROPERTIES (2)$19.190$15 TO $20    SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTION   CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPURCHASE (1)46.5248—CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK (3)—1664COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE ($200 MILLION AUTHORIZATION) (4)—234TBD $65.6$331TBD(1) THE COMPANY ISSUED $320 MILLION OF 2.0% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2043 IN EXCHANGE FOR 257,110 SHARES OF THE COMPANY’S 6.5% SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK.

ALSO, 2012 AND 2013 INCLUDES AN INVESTMENT FOR A REPLACEMENT HOSPITAL FOR THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUSLY LEASED HOSPITAL IN LUDLOW, MASSACHUSETTS. (3) ON JULY 25, 2013, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE INITIATION OF A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND ON THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK OF $0.18 PER SHARE. (4) ON OCTOBER 25, 2013, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $200 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THE $234 MILLION REFLECTS THE TENDER OFFER FOR APPROXIMATELY 9.5% OF THE COMMON SHARES COMPLETED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013.  THE COMPANY USES “SAME-STORE” COMPARISONS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS AND LINE ITEMS WITHIN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT PERIODS AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN  ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 (THE “2012 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 10, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2013 (THE “SEPTEMBER 2013 FORM 10-Q”), AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2012 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE CONFERENCE SLIDES ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2012 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2013 FORM 10-Q FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED EBITDA THREE MONTHS ENDED NINE MONTHS ENDED           SEPTEMBER 30, SEPTEMBER 30, YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 2012 2013 2012 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 (IN MILLIONS)NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES$142.6 $107.2 $369.4 $302.2 $411.5 $342.7 $331.0 $406.1 $227.2PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS(8.0) (7.0) (22.4) (19.8) (27.0) (21.0) (16.4) (30.7) (23.0)PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL4.2 4.1 7.8 13.2 16.1 21.0 17.2 8.8 44.4INTEREST EXPENSE AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT                 DISCOUNTS AND FEES25.3 23.5 73.9 69.8 94.1 119.4 125.6 125.7 159.3UBS SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS, GROSS— — — — — — — (100.0) —EQUITY IN NET INCOME OF NONCONSOLIDATED                 AFFILIATES2.0 3.3 8.2 9.7 12.7 12.0 10.1 4.6 10.6NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING                  INTERESTS IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS(14.1) (12.8) (42.5) (38.6) (50.9) (47.0) (40.9) (33.3) (29.8)AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNTS AND FEES(1.0) (0.9) (3.0) (2.7) (3.7) (4.2) (6.3) (6.6) (6.5)DISTRIBUTIONS FROM NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES(4.6) (2.4) (9.6) (7.9) (11.0) (13.0) (8.1) (8.6) (10.9)CURRENT PORTION OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)2.5 (0.6) 3.0 3.7 5.9 0.6 2.9 (7.0) (72.8)CHANGE IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES(14.4) 10.4 21.8 48.8 58.1 41.4 5.7 9.1 58.0NET PREMIUM PAID ON BOND                 ISSUANCE/REDEMPTION— — — — 1.9 22.8 — — —NET CASH USED IN (PROVIDED BY) OPERATING                 ACTIVITIES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS1.2 0.2 1.4 (1.5) (2.0) (9.1) (13.2) (5.7) (32.5)OTHER, INCLUDING REALIZED LOSSES AND (GAINS)                  ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS(0.2) 0.2 1.3 0.4 0.2 0.6 2.0 1.3 (1.4)ADJUSTED EBITDA$135.5 $125.2 $409.3 $377.3 $505.9 $466.2 $409.6 $363.7 $322.6FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2013, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $95.8 MILLION AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ""LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,"" AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE “2013 FORM 10‑K”), WHEN FILED. THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY'S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE 2013 FORM 10‑K, WHEN FILED, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP""), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY'S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARES EXCLUDES, DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD PRESENTED, (I) THE EFFECT OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (II) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF

ON APRIL 3, 2014, AN UNFAVORABLE JURY VERDICT WAS DELIVERED AGAINST NUVASIVE, INC. (NUVASIVE) RELATING TO
NUVASIVES USE OF THE TRADE NAME NEUROVISION IN THE AMOUNT OF $30.0 MILLION. NUVASIVE STRONGLY DISAGREES WITH THE VERDICT AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS RIGHT TO USE THE NEUROVISION TRADEMARK. THE COMPANY INTENDS
TO FILE POST-TRIAL MOTIONS IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA (THE DISTRICT COURT) SEEKING JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW, AND, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A NEW TRIAL. IF NECESSARY, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO APPEAL THE
VERDICT TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS (THE CIRCUIT COURT). IN THE EVENT NUVASIVES POST-TRIAL MOTIONS ARE DENIED AND JUDGMENT IS ULTIMATELY ENTERED BY THE DISTRICT COURT, ANY PAYMENT OF DAMAGES PER THE JUDGMENT WILL BE
STAYED PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE APPEALS PROCESS (WHICH COULD TAKE UP TO TWO YEARS).  NUVASIVE HAS BEEN IN LITIGATION
WITH NMP OVER THIS MATTER SINCE SEPTEMBER 2009, WHEN NMP INITIALLY FILED SUIT. IN JANUARY 2011, AFTER TRIAL OF THE MATTER, THE DISTRICT COURT ORDERED THAT A JUDGMENT AGAINST NUVASIVE BE ENTERED IN THE CASE IN THE AMOUNT OF $60.0 MILLION, PLUS
ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS, INCLUDING A PERMANENT INJUNCTION PROHIBITING NUVASIVES USE OF THE NEUROVISION NAME FOR MARKETING PURPOSES. NUVASIVE PROMPTLY APPEALED THE VERDICT TO THE CIRCUIT COURT, AND, IN SEPTEMBER 2012, THE CIRCUIT
COURT ISSUED A RULING THAT:   


 
 
 
 REVERSED AND VACATED THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT AGAINST NUVASIVE; 
 


 
 
 
 REVERSED AND VACATED THE INJUNCTION AND THE AWARD OF ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS AGAINST NUVASIVE; 
 


 
 
 
 REMANDED THE CASE BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL; AND 
 


 
 
 
 INSTRUCTED THE DISTRICT COURT TO ASSIGN THE CASE TO A DIFFERENT JUDGE FOR THE NEW TRIAL. 
THIS CASE RELATES SOLELY TO THE USE OF THE NEUROVISION BRAND NAME AND HAS NO IMPACT ON NUVASIVES PROPRIETARY
NEUROMONITORING TECHNOLOGY THAT UNDERLIES NUVASIVES NVM5® NERVE MONITORING SYSTEM OR FUTURE PRODUCTS. NUVASIVE DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY DISRUPTION TO SALES OR THE ABILITY TO MEET SURGERY

THE MERGER AGREEMENT WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY AKORN’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
 
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
 
THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MERGER.  THE AGGREGATE MERGER CONSIDERATION (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT) PAID FOR ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS OF VPI WILL BE EQUAL TO $440,000,000, SUBJECT TO VARIOUS POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL, CASH, TRANSACTION EXPENSES AND FUNDED INDEBTEDNESS. UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER, EACH SHARE OF VPI’S COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO SUCH TIME, OTHER THAN THOSE SHARES HELD IN TREASURY BY VPI, OWNED BY AKORN, ACQUISITION SUBSIDIARY OR VPI OR ANY OTHER SUBSIDIARY OF VPI (EACH OF WHICH WILL BE CANCELLED) AND TO WHICH DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS HAVE BEEN PROPERLY EXERCISED, WILL BE CANCELLED AND CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE ITS PER SHARE RIGHT TO THE AGGREGATE MERGER CONSIDERATION, SUBJECT TO VARIOUS POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL, CASH, TRANSACTION EXPENSES AND FUNDED INDEBTEDNESS.  IN ADDITION, ALL STOCK OPTIONS OF VPI HELD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER WILL BECOME FULLY VESTED AND WILL BE CANCELLED UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER WITH THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE PAYMENT ON THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT.
 
PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES HAVE MADE CERTAIN CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS TO EACH OTHER, INCLUDING USING REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS TO TAKE, OR CAUSE TO BE TAKEN, ALL ACTIONS AND DO ALL THINGS NECESSARY, PROPER OR ADVISABLE TO CONSUMMATE AND MAKE EFFECTIVE THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE SATISFACTION OF EACH OF THE PARTIES’ RESPECTIVE CLOSING CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT.  VPI HAS ALSO AGREED TO VARIOUS COVENANTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, (I) TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICES DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE EXECUTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MERGER AND NOT TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS DURING SUCH PERIOD, AND (II) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS OR NEGOTIATIONS CONCERNING ANY ALTERNATIVE ACQUISITION PROPOSAL.
 
THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, (I) THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE WAITING PERIODS (INCLUDING ANY EXTENSION THEREOF) UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1976 (THE “HSR ACT”), AS AMENDED, (II) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MATERIALITY EXCEPTIONS, THE ACCURACY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY VPI, AKORN AND ACQUISITION SUBSIDIARY, RESPECTIVELY, (III) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS, COMPLIANCE IN ALL RESPECTS BY VPI, AKORN AND ACQUISITION SUBSIDIARY WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE MERGER AGREEMENT, (IV) THE ABSENCE OF ANY CHANGE OR EFFECT ON VPI THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT) AND (V) THE ABSENCE OF ANY ORDER, INJUNCTION, RULING, JUDGMENT OR DECREE BY ANY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY THAT MAKES ILLEGAL OR OTHERWISE RESTRAINS, PREVENTS OR PROHIBITS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER.
 
THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014.
 
THE MERGER AGREEMENT CONTAINS TERMINATION RIGHTS FOR VPI, AKORN AND ACQUISITION SUBSIDIARY.    THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT AKORN WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY VPI A TERMINATION FEE OF $22,000,000 IF, ON OR PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 5, 2014 (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SUCH DATE IS EXTENDED TO DECEMBER 5, 2014) (AS SUCH DATE MAY BE EXTENDED, THE “TERMINATION DATE”), THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED BY VPI AS A RESULT OF A FINANCING FAILURE (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT).  IN THE EVENT THAT AKORN EXERCISES ITS RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE MERGER AGREEMENT DUE TO THE TRANSACTION NOT HAVING CLOSED AS OF THE TERMINATION DATE, BUT AT SUCH TIME VPI WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TERMINATE THE MERGER AGREEMENT AS A RESULT OF A FINANCING FAILURE, AKORN WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PAY VPI A TERMINATION FEE OF $22,000,000.
 


  


  





  


 
FURTHER, THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF VPI WITH CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS FOLLOWING THE MERGER.

THE INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN IS EXPECTED TO BEAR INTEREST, AT AKORN’S OPTION, AT RATES EQUAL TO AN ADJUSTED EURODOLLAR RATE OR AN ALTERNATE BASE RATE, IN EACH CASE, PLUS A SPREAD.

THE INVESTIGATION IS BEING CONDUCTED BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (THE “DOJ”). HEALTHSOUTH ALSO PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THAT THE DOJ, THROUGH FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATIONS, INDICATED IT INTENDED TO REQUEST FILES FROM ADDITIONAL HOSPITALS. AFTER MARKET CLOSE ON APRIL 24, 2014, HEALTHSOUTH RECEIVED DOCUMENT SUBPOENAS RELATING TO AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN OF ITS HOSPITALS. THE NEW SUBPOENAS REFERENCE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR INVESTIGATION SUBJECT MATTER AS THE ORIGINAL SUBPOENAS AND REQUEST MATERIALS FROM THE PERIOD JANUARY 2008 THROUGH DECEMBER 2013. TWO OF THE FOUR HOSPITALS ADDRESSED IN THE ORIGINAL SET OF SUBPOENAS HAVE RECEIVED SUPPLEMENTAL SUBPOENAS TO COVER THIS NEW TIME PERIOD. THE NEW SUBPOENAS DO NOT INCLUDE REQUESTS FOR SPECIFIC PATIENT FILES, BUT IT IS EXPECTED THAT SUCH REQUESTS WILL BE MADE FOR THE NEW GROUP OF HOSPITALS. ALL OF THE SUBPOENAS ARE IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGED IMPROPER OR FRAUDULENT CLAIMS SUBMITTED TO MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND REQUEST DOCUMENTS AND MATERIALS RELATING TO PRACTICES, PROCEDURES, PROTOCOLS AND POLICIES, OF CERTAIN PRE- AND POST-ADMISSIONS ACTIVITIES AT THESE HOSPITALS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MARKETING FUNCTIONS, PRE-ADMISSION SCREENING, POST-ADMISSION PHYSICIAN EVALUATIONS, PATIENT ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS, INDIVIDUALIZED PATIENT PLANS OF CARE, AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE MEDICARE 60% RULE. UNDER THE MEDICARE RULE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE “60% RULE,” AN INPATIENT REHABILITATION HOSPITAL MUST TREAT 60% OR MORE OF ITS PATIENTS FROM AT LEAST ONE OF A SPECIFIED LIST OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO BE REIMBURSED AT THE INPATIENT REHABILITATION HOSPITAL PAYMENT RATES, RATHER THAN AT THE LOWER ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL PAYMENT RATES. IN 2009, THE UNITED STATES CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES ISSUED NEW COVERAGE RULES AND COVERAGE CRITERIA APPLICABLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT AS AN INPATIENT REHABILITATION HOSPITAL THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2010. MANY OF THESE RULES AND CRITERIA FOCUSED ON THE ADEQUACY OF DOCUMENTATION, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ENSURING A PATIENT’S MEDICAL RECORD CONTAINED CERTAIN INFORMATION, SUCH AS PRE-ADMISSION SCREENING DOCUMENTATION AND POST-ADMISSION PHYSICIAN EVALUATIONS. HEALTHSOUTH, IN ADVANCE OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE NEW COVERAGE RULES AND COVERAGE CRITERIA, UNDERTOOK EFFORTS TO PUBLISH AN EXTENSIVE COMPLIANCE GUIDE AND TO INSTITUTE A STANDARDIZED, COMPANY-WIDE TRAINING PROGRAM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE NEW COVERAGE RULES AND CRITERIA. HEALTHSOUTH ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT ON-GOING TRAINING AND EDUCATION REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH THESE RULES AND CRITERIA.HEALTHSOUTH IS COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE DOJ IN CONNECTION WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND IS CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PREDICT THE TIMING OR OUTCOME OF THIS INVESTIGATION. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSSTATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 8-K WHICH ARE NOT HISTORICAL FACTS, SUCH AS THE TIMING OR OUTCOME OF THE DOJ INVESTIGATION DISCUSSED ABOVE, ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, HEALTHSOUTH, THROUGH ITS SENIOR MANAGEMENT, MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING PUBLIC STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE MATTERS DESCRIBED HEREIN. ALL SUCH ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS, AND FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, AND HEALTHSOUTH UNDERTAKES NO DUTY TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVISE SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS, OR OTHERWISE.

SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT PERIODS AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, A COPY OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED DURING THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS CALL AT 9:00 A.M.

THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ""LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,"" AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE “2013 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY'S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 8, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2014 (THE ""MARCH 2014 FORM 10-Q""), WHEN FILED, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP""), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10-K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2.

REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.SUBSEQUENT TO ITS EARNINGS RELEASE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, HEALTHSOUTH CORPORATION (“HEALTHSOUTH” OR THE “COMPANY”) ASSEMBLED AN INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK, WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8‑K AS EXHIBIT 99.1 (THE “INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK”). THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ADDRESSES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY AND ITS INDUSTRY, A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS OUTLOOK, THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL METRICS AND INITIATIVES, AND THE COMPANY’S VALUE PROPOSITION. THE COMPANY’S PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE MEDICARE PROPOSED RULE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 FOR INPATIENT REHABILITATION FACILITIES UNDER THE PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM IS ALSO INCLUDED. THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM BY CLICKING ON AN AVAILABLE LINK.THE COMPANY REITERATES AS OF THE DATE HEREOF ITS GUIDANCE FOR 2014, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE FURNISHED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THE CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K DATED APRIL 28, 2014 AND DURING THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL HELD ON APRIL 29, 2014.THE COMPANY USES “SAME-STORE” COMPARISONS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS AND LINE ITEMS WITHIN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT PERIODS AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE “2013 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10‑K AND NOTE 8, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2014 (THE “MARCH 2014 FORM 10‑Q”), AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

AS OF JUNE 17, 2014, THE COMPANY HAS UPDATED THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK, WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8‑K AS EXHIBIT 99.1 (THE “INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK”), TO INCORPORATE THE IMPACT OF THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE COMPANY ACQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL 30% EQUITY INTEREST FROM UMASS MEMORIAL HEALTH CARE, ITS JOINT VENTURE PARTNER IN FAIRLAWN REHABILITATION HOSPITAL IN WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS. THIS TRANSACTION INCREASED HEALTHSOUTH'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST FROM 50% TO 80% AND RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR THIS HOSPITAL FROM THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO A CONSOLIDATED ENTITY. THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM BY CLICKING ON AN AVAILABLE LINK.BASED ON ITS RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 AND THE ADDITIONAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN FAIRLAWN REHABILITATION HOSPITAL, HEALTHSOUTH EXPECTS, AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, TO EXCEED THE HIGH END OF ITS ADJUSTED EBITDA AND EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE RANGES. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THESE GUIDANCE RANGES ARE:•ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $555 MILLION TO $565 MILLION•EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH OF $1.86 TO $1.91THE COMPANY WILL ALSO PROVIDE ITS INITIAL OBSERVATIONS FOR SOLID VOLUMES IN APRIL AND MAY 2014.

VINCENT REHABILITATION HOSPITAL IN SHERWOOD, ARKANSAS, THE ACQUISITION OF WALTON REHABILITATION HOSPITAL IN AUGUSTA, GEORGIA, AND THREE DE NOVO HOSPITALS (OCALA, FLORIDA; LITTLETON, COLORADO; AND STUART, FLORIDA). THE COMPANY USES “SAME-STORE” COMPARISONS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS AND LINE ITEMS WITHIN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAME-STORE COMPARISONS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON HOSPITALS OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH THE FULL CURRENT PERIODS AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HEALTHSOUTH CORPORATION WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE 2014 WELLS FARGO SECURITIES HEALTHCARE CONFERENCE IN BOSTON ON JUNE 17-18, 2014. HEALTHSOUTH PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, JAY GRINNEY, WILL PARTICIPATE IN A FIRESIDE CHAT PRESENTATION ON WEDNESDAY, JUNE 18TH AT 10:40 A.M. ET AND REFERENCE SELECTED SLIDES INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK. THE PRESENTATION WILL ADDRESS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND DISCUSS INDUSTRY TRENDS AND DYNAMICS. THE PRESENTATION WILL BE WEBCAST LIVE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM BY CLICKING ON AN AVAILABLE LINK.THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE “2013 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10‑K AND NOTE 8, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2014 (THE “MARCH 2014 FORM 10‑Q”), AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE 2013 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE MARCH 2014 FORM 10-Q FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  ON APRIL 30, 2014, TELEFLEX
INCORPORATED (THE COMPANY) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE (THE PRESS RELEASE) ANNOUNCING ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 30, 2014. A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS CURRENT
REPORT.  IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (GAAP), THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH. ADJUSTED DILUTED
EARNINGS PER SHARES EXCLUDES, DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD PRESENTED, (I) THE EFFECT OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (II) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT;
(III) THE GAIN OR LOSS ON SALES OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS; (IV) LOSSES AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS, THE REVERSAL OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ARRANGEMENTS, THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF A LITIGATION RESERVE AND A LITIGATION VERDICT AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO A NON-OPERATING JOINT VENTURE; (V) AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT DISCOUNT ON THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES; (VI) INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE; AND
(VII) TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEARS TAX MATTERS AND THE FILING OF PRIOR YEARS AMENDED TAX RETURNS. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED SHARES WITHIN ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GIVES EFFECT TO THE
ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS, WHICH REDUCE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DILUTION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD OCCUR UPON CONVERSION OF THE COMPANYS SENIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE NOTES (UNDER GAAP, THE
ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTED IN DILUTED SHARES). CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE AND GROWTH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING THE RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AT DIFFERENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES
FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. 
MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF PAST AND
PRESENT OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO
THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. MANAGEMENT USES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, WHEN PUBLICLY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND TO
ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATION OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. HOWEVER, SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS PRESENTED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. 
THE INFORMATION FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 2.02 OF THIS CURRENT REPORT, INCLUDING EXHIBIT 99.1 HERETO, SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED
FILED FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, OR OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO THE LIABILITY OF SUCH SECTION, NOR SHALL IT BE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO FUTURE FILINGS BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, UNLESS THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY SETS FORTH IN SUCH FUTURE FILING THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS TO BE CONSIDERED FILED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

ITEM. 2.05.
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES.  ON APRIL 28, 2014, THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN (THE PLAN) DESIGNED TO REDUCE COSTS, IMPROVE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND ENHANCE THE COMPANYS LONG TERM COMPETITIVE POSITION. THE PLAN, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO
CONTINUING COST PRESSURES IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY, INVOLVES THE CONSOLIDATION OF OPERATIONS AND A RELATED REDUCTION IN WORKFORCE AT CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS FACILITIES, AND WILL INCLUDE THE RELOCATION OF MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS FROM CERTAIN
HIGHER-COST LOCATIONS TO EXISTING LOWER-COST LOCATIONS. THESE ACTIONS WILL COMMENCE IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2014 AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2017. 
THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL INCUR AGGREGATE PRE-TAX CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $42
MILLION TO $53 MILLION, OF WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION TO $23 MILLION WILL BE INCURRED IN 2014 AND MOST OF THE BALANCE WILL BE INCURRED PRIOR TO THE END OF 2016. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT IT WILL EXCLUDE THESE
CHARGES FROM ITS ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE RESULTS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT $32 MILLION TO $40 MILLION OF THE AGGREGATE PRE-TAX CHARGES WILL RESULT IN FUTURE CASH OUTLAYS, OF WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION TO $11
MILLION WILL BE MADE IN 2014 AND MOST OF THE BALANCE WILL BE MADE PRIOR TO THE END OF 2016. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MAKE $24 MILLION TO $30 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLAN, OF WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS
APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION TO $15 MILLION WILL BE MADE IN 2014.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT COST

EXPECTS TO REALIZE PLAN-RELATED SAVINGS BEGINNING IN 2015.  AS THE PLAN IS IMPLEMENTED, MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE ESTIMATED
COSTS AND ANTICIPATED SAVINGS SET FORTH ABOVE, AND MAY REVISE ITS ESTIMATES OF SUCH COSTS AND ANTICIPATED SAVINGS AND THE ACCOUNTING CHARGES RELATING THERETO, AS APPROPRIATE, CONSISTENT WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNANTICIPATED DIFFICULTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATION OF MANUFACTURING AND

ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2014, TENET HEALTHCARE CORPORATION (TENET) ISSUED $500,000,000 IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.50% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2019 (THE NOTES).

THE NOTES WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE INDENTURE, DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 6, 2001, BETWEEN TENET AND THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON TRUST COMPANY, N.A.

EASTERN TIME ON TUESDAY, JULY 29, 2014 IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ""LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,"" AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE “2013 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY'S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 10, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 (THE ""JUNE 2014 FORM 10-Q""), WHEN FILED, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP""), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10-K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY'S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE JUNE 2014 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED, AND IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1.

THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.HEALTHSOUTH CORPORATION (THE “COMPANY” OR “HEALTHSOUTH”) WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE BAIRD 2014 HEALTHCARE CONFERENCE  IN NEW YORK ON SEPTEMBER 3-4, 2014. HEALTHSOUTH EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, MARK TARR, WILL PARTICIPATE IN A FIRESIDE CHAT PRESENTATION ON WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3RD AT 2:55 P.M. ET AND REFERENCE SELECTED SLIDES PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 (THE “INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK”) TO THE CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8‑K DATED AUGUST 20, 2014. THE PRESENTATION WILL ADDRESS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND DISCUSS INDUSTRY TRENDS AND DYNAMICS. THE PRESENTATIONS WILL BE WEBCAST LIVE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM BY CLICKING ON AN AVAILABLE LINK.THE COMPANY WILL PROVIDE ITS OBSERVATIONS THAT VOLUMES IN JULY AND AUGUST 2014 WERE IN LINE WITH ITS GUIDANCE CONSIDERATIONS OF 4.3% TO 5.3% FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2014. AS A REMINDER, DISCHARGE GROWTH FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014 WILL INCLUDE NEW-STORE GROWTH FROM THE CONSOLIDATION OF FAIRLAWN REHABILITATION HOSPITAL IN WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS. NEW-STORE GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013 INCLUDED THE ACQUISITION OF WALTON REHABILITATION HOSPITAL IN AUGUSTA, GEORGIA AND THREE DE NOVO HOSPITALS (OCALA, FLORIDA; LITTLETON, COLORADO; AND STUART, FLORIDA). THE COMPANY WILL ALSO REITERATE ITS 2014 GUIDANCE, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN THE CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K DATED AUGUST 20, 2014 AND JULY 28, 2014 AND DURING THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL HELD ON JULY 29, 2014. THAT IS, THE COMPANY STILL EXPECTS TO BE WITHIN THE FOLLOWING RANGES:•ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $570 TO $580 MILLION; AND•EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH OF $2.25 TO $2.31.IN ADDITION, ON AUGUST 29, 2014, THE COMPANY GAVE NOTICE TO NOTEHOLDERS OF ITS INTENT TO REDEEM THE REMAINING $271.4 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ITS OUTSTANDING 7.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2018 WHEN THEY BECOME CALLABLE IN OCTOBER 2014. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS BEING FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 7.01 OF FORM 8-K, “REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.” THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK INCLUDES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE “2013 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS (IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2012), (3) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (4) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10‑K AND NOTE 10, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 (THE “JUNE 2014 FORM 10‑Q”), AND (5) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10‑K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE INVESTOR REFERENCE BOOK. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE PRECISE DETAILS OF THESE NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING TIMING AND CONTENT, WILL BE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE UNITED STATES CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS WILL TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.•WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT “QUANTIFY” THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL EFFECT OF THE IMPACT ACT ON HEALTHSOUTH, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ANY POST-ACUTE PAYMENT SYSTEM THAT IS DATA-DRIVEN AND FOCUSES ON THE NEEDS AND UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS OF POST-ACUTE PATIENTS WILL BE POSITIVE FOR PROVIDERS WHO OFFER HIGH-QUALITY, COST-EFFECTIVE CARE.  HEALTHSOUTH BELIEVES IT IS DOING JUST THAT AND EXPECTS THIS ACT WILL BE POSITIVE FOR THE COMPANY.•HOWEVER, IT WILL LIKELY TAKE YEARS FOR THE RELATED QUALITY MEASURES TO BE ESTABLISHED, QUALITY DATA TO BE GATHERED, STANDARDIZED PATIENT ASSESSMENT DATA TO BE ASSEMBLED AND DISSEMINATED, AND POTENTIAL PAYMENT POLICIES TO BE DEVELOPED, TESTED AND PROMULGATED.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  ON JULY 30, 2014, TELEFLEX
INCORPORATED (THE COMPANY) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE (THE PRESS RELEASE) ANNOUNCING ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 29, 2014. A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT.
 IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (GAAP), THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH. ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS
PER SHARES EXCLUDES, DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD PRESENTED, (I) THE EFFECT OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (II) LOSSES AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO ACQUISITION AND
INTEGRATION COSTS, THE REVERSAL OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ARRANGEMENTS, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LITIGATION RESERVE AND A LITIGATION VERDICT AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO A NON-OPERATING JOINT VENTURE;
(III) AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT DISCOUNT ON THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES; (IV) INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE; AND (V) TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF, OR EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WITH RESPECT TO,
PRIOR YEARS TAX MATTERS. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED SHARES WITHIN ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GIVES EFFECT TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS, WHICH REDUCE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC
DILUTION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD OCCUR UPON CONVERSION OF THE COMPANYS SENIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE NOTES (UNDER GAAP, THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTED IN DILUTED SHARES). CONSTANT CURRENCY
REVENUE AND GROWTH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING THE RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AT DIFFERENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST
DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO
INVESTORS TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF PAST AND PRESENT OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS
USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. MANAGEMENT USES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, WHEN PUBLICLY
PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATION OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. HOWEVER, SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES
PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS PRESENTED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND BELOW.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE “2013 FORM 10‑K”) AND NOTE 4, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE COMPANY’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 (THE “SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10-Q”), WHEN FILED. THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 11, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10-K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED, AND IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.ON NOVEMBER 24, 2014, THE COMPANY ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, ANNOUNCING THAT THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO THE AGREEMENT REFERENCED HEREIN.IN THIS PRESS RELEASE, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A CONFERENCE CALL TO BE HELD AT 11:00 A.M. EASTERN TIME ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2014. A COPY OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED DURING THE COMPANY’S CALL IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THE INFORMATION UNDER THIS ITEM 7.01 ALONG WITH EXHIBITS 99.1 AND 99.2 ATTACHED HERETO ARE BEING FURNISHED AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), NOR SHALL IT BE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING. THE FURNISHING OF EXHIBITS 99.1 AND 99.2 ATTACHED HERETO ARE NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A DETERMINATION BY THE COMPANY THAT THE INFORMATION IS MATERIAL OR THAT THE DISSEMINATION OF THE INFORMATION IS REQUIRED BY REGULATION FD.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT AS EXHIBIT 99.2 INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILED HISTORICAL ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE FORM10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 (THE “SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10‑Q”) AVAILABLE ON THE COMPANY’S WEBSITE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM UNDER SEC FILINGS.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE “2013 FORM 10‑K”) AND NOTE 4, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10-Q. THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT-ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO-COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 11, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10-Q, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10-K.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCERTAIN STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO THE PURCHASE PRICE AND THE LIKELIHOOD, TIMING AND EFFECTS OF THE COMPLETION OF THIS ACQUISITION.

THE COMPANY RECONCILED HISTORICAL ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME IN THE FORM10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 (THE “SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10‑Q”) AVAILABLE ON THE COMPANY’S WEBSITE AT HTTP://INVESTOR.HEALTHSOUTH.COM UNDER SEC FILINGS.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 (THE “2013 FORM 10‑K”) AND NOTE 4, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), OF THE SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10-Q. THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT-ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO-COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT NOT BE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA” THERE, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS RELATED TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP AND RICHARD SCRUSHY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2013 FORM 10-K AND NOTE 11, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2014 FORM 10-Q, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION. THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“GAAP”), AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.

ON OCTOBER 29, 2014, TELEFLEX INCORPORATED (THE “COMPANY”) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE (THE “PRESS RELEASE”) ANNOUNCING ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2014.  A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT. IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”), THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH.  ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARES EXCLUDES, DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD PRESENTED, (I) THE EFFECT OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (II) LOSSES, OTHER CHARGES AND CHARGE REVERSALS, INCLUDING ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS, CHARGES RELATED TO FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS, REVERSAL OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ARRANGEMENTS, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LITIGATION RESERVE AND A LITIGATION VERDICT AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO A NON-OPERATING JOINT VENTURE AND REVERSAL OF A RESERVE RELATED TO A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED STOCK KEEPING UNIT BENEFIT PROGRAM; (III) AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT DISCOUNT ON THE COMPANY’S CONVERTIBLE NOTES; (IV) INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE; (V) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; AND (VI) TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF, OR EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WITH RESPECT TO, PRIOR YEARS’ TAX MATTERS. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED SHARES WITHIN ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GIVES EFFECT TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY’S CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS, WHICH REDUCE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DILUTION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD OCCUR UPON CONVERSION OF THE COMPANY’S SENIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE NOTES (UNDER GAAP, THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTED IN DILUTED SHARES).  CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE AND GROWTH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING THE RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AT DIFFERENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF PAST AND PRESENT OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. MANAGEMENT USES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, WHEN PUBLICLY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATION OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. HOWEVER, SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS PRESENTED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

ATTACHMENT C TO THE NPA. THE TERM OF THE NPA WILL BE THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE ON WHICH THE MONITOR IS RETAINED, UNLESS THE NPA IS EXTENDED OR TERMINATED EARLY AS DESCRIBED THEREIN. 


PURSUANT TO THE NPA, THE OFFICES AGREE THAT THEY WILL NOT BRING ANY CRIMINAL OR CIVIL CASE
AGAINST THSMI OR ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES, INCLUDING TENET, RELATING TO THE CONDUCT DESCRIBED IN THE NPA. HOWEVER, IF, DURING THE TERM OF THE NPA, THSMI COMMITS ANY FELONY UNDER FEDERAL LAW, OR IF TENET COMMITS ANY FELONY RELATED TO THE FEDERAL
ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE, OR IF THSMI OR TENET FAIL TO COOPERATE OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THE NPA, THEN THSMI, TENET AND THEIR AFFILIATES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION FOR ANY FEDERAL CRIMINAL VIOLATION OF WHICH THE
OFFICES HAVE KNOWLEDGE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE CONDUCT DESCRIBED IN THE NPA. THE OFFICES RETAIN SOLE DISCRETION OVER DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH OF THE NPA AND WHETHER TO PURSUE PROSECUTION.

AGREEMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS RELATING TO THE RESOLUTION OF THE CLINICA DE LA MAMA CIVIL LITIGATION AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THE RESOLUTION DOCUMENTS COULD SUBJECT US TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND OTHER
MATERIAL SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES. THE SETTLEMENT AND RESOLUTION OF THE CLINICA DE LA MAMA MATTERS IS SUBJECT TO COURT ACCEPTANCE OF THE PLEA AGREEMENTS. ALTHOUGH TENET BELIEVES SUCH ACCEPTANCE WILL BE OBTAINED, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT COURT
ACCEPTANCE WILL BE RECEIVED. IF COURT ACCEPTANCE IS NOT OBTAINED, AND THE TERMS OF ANY FINAL RESOLUTION ARE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE RESOLUTION TO WHICH WE HAVE AGREED, THE EVENTUAL LOSS RELATED TO THESE MATTERS COULD MATERIALLY EXCEED THE
AMOUNT RESERVED AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

THESE COMPARISONS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS IN EXISTING MARKETS, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, WITH PRECISION, THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.ON OCTOBER 27, 2016, THE COMPANY ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE REPORTING THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016.

THIS INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 18 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.NOTE REGARDING PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHE FINANCIAL DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, LEVERAGE RATIO, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW.THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HEALTHSOUTH (“ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE”). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE PROVIDES USEFUL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES BETTER COMPARABILITY OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE TO PRIOR PERIODS GIVEN THAT IT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS; PROFESSIONAL FEES—ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL; MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS; GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS; LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS); ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS; AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE EXCLUDED ITEMS WILL OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THEY CAN COMPLICATE COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACROSS PERIODS AND COMPARISONS OF THE COMPANY’S RESULTS TO THOSE OF OTHER HEALTHCARE COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”) AS THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM IT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE AS PRESENTED TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2.THE LEVERAGE RATIO REFERENCED THEREIN IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LEVERAGE RATIO AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEASURES OF ITS ABILITY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT USED BY INVESTORS TO GAUGE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF AN INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DEDUCT UP TO $75 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND FROM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT. THE COMPANY RECONCILES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME AND TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS RECONCILED TO NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2.THE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS A LIQUIDITY MEASURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IS IMPORTANT IN ANALYZING ITS LIQUIDITY BECAUSE IT IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL COVENANTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,” AND NOTE 8, LONG-TERM DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10‑K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 (THE “2015 FORM 10‑K”). THESE COVENANTS ARE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT—ITS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND ITS LEVERAGE RATIO—COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY’S LENDERS REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ALL AMOUNTS BORROWED. IF THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED A POTENTIAL COVENANT VIOLATION, IT WOULD SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS LENDERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOME COST TO THE COMPANY, AND SUCH RELIEF MIGHT BE ON TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THOSE IN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SATISFY THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, IT WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, PAYING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY.IN GENERAL TERMS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, THEREIN REFERRED TO AS “ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,” ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND THEN ADD BACK TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (1) ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS REDUCING CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (OF WHICH ONLY UP TO $10 MILLION IN A YEAR MAY BE CASH EXPENDITURES), (2) ANY LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS, (3) COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES, INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (4) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBTRACTS FROM CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ALL UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING ITEMS TO THE EXTENT THEY INCREASE CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION DOES NOT INCLUDE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND INCLUDES (1) GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, (2) PROFESSIONAL FEES UNRELATED TO THE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, AND (3) UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING CASH EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION, AND (4) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. ITEMS FALLING WITHIN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT’S “UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING” CLASSIFICATION MAY OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, BUT THESE ITEMS AND AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S ONGOING OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THESE ITEMS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE COMPANY’S ONGOING PERFORMANCE, SO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA CALCULATION PRESENTED HERE INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEM.ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP, AND THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASUREMENT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE 2015 FORM 10-K.THE COMPANY ALSO USES ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AS AN ANALYTICAL INDICATOR TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS AN EFFICIENT MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CAPACITY TO REDUCE DEBT, PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.2. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A DEFINED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. BECAUSE THIS MEASURE IS NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, IT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SEE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2016 FORM 10-Q, WHEN FILED, AND IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR THE GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. EXCLUDING NET OPERATING REVENUES, THE COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON A GAAP BASIS BECAUSE IT IS UNABLE TO PREDICT, WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY, THE FUTURE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. SUCH ITEMS INCLUDE GOVERNMENT, CLASS ACTION, AND RELATED SETTLEMENTS; PROFESSIONAL FEES-ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND LEGAL; MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS; GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS; LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS INCOME TAX PROVISION (SUCH AS VALUATION ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF INCOME TAX CLAIMS); ITEMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AND FACILITY RESTRUCTURINGS; AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE NON-INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. THESE ITEMS ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, AND COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSTHE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE PRESS RELEASE AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION INCLUDES CERTAIN ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS, AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS AND RELATE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUTURE EVENTS, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS STRATEGY, FINANCIAL PLANS, DIVIDEND STRATEGIES OR PAYMENTS, EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES, PLANS TO REPURCHASE ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES, FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, PROJECTED BUSINESS RESULTS OR MODEL, ABILITY TO RETURN VALUE TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS, PROJECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, LEVERAGE RATIO, ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, AND THE IMPACT OF FUTURE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION.

A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS FURNISHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THIS CURRENT REPORT. IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (“GAAP”), THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH.  ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARES EXCLUDES, DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD PRESENTED, (I) RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (II) CERTAIN LOSSES AND OTHER CHARGES, INCLUDING, FOR 2016, CHARGES RELATED TO FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES, NET OF THE GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS AND, FOR 2015, CHARGES RELATED TO ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS, AND CHARGES RELATED TO FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS, NET OF THE GAIN ON SALE OF  ASSETS AND REVERSAL OF CHARGES RELATED TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AND A LITIGATION VERDICT AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO A NON-OPERATING JOINT VENTURE; (III) AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT DISCOUNT ON THE COMPANY’S CONVERTIBLE NOTES; (IV) INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE; (V) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; AND (VI) TAX BENEFITS RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM THE RESOLUTION OF AUDITS OF PRIOR YEAR RETURNS AND TAX LAW CHANGES AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY.  IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED SHARES WITHIN ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GIVES EFFECT TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY’S CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS, WHICH REDUCE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DILUTION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD OCCUR UPON CONVERSION OF THE COMPANY’S SENIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE NOTES (UNDER GAAP, THE ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGREEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTED IN DILUTED SHARES).  CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUE AND GROWTH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING THE RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AT DIFFERENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF PAST AND PRESENT OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP DILUTED SHARES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE OFFSETTING ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AGAINST CONVERSIONS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. MANAGEMENT USES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, WHEN PUBLICLY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATION OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. HOWEVER, SUCH NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS PRESENTED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.
