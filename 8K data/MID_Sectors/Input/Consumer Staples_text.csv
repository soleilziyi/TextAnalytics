A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING THE DIVIDEND DECLARATION IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.2 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.THE INFORMATION FURNISHED PURSUANT TO THIS ITEM 7.01, INCLUDING THE ATTACHED EXHIBIT, SHALL NOT BE DEEMED “FILED” FOR PURPOSES OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), OR OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO THE LIABILITIES OF SUCH SECTION, NOR SHALL SUCH INFORMATION OR EXHIBIT BE DEEMED INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT AS SHALL BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH BY SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN SUCH A FILING.ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR OUR VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY WERE CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE RULES GOVERNING THE TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN A HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMY BASED ON THE USE OF THE BLENDED NATIONAL CONSUMER PRICE INDEX IN VENEZUELA. UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AN ECONOMY IS CONSIDERED HIGHLY INFLATIONARY IF THE CUMULATIVE INFLATION RATE FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD MEETS OR EXCEEDS 100 PERCENT. IF A SUBSIDIARY IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN A HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMY, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE SUBSIDIARY MUST BE RE-MEASURED INTO OUR REPORTING CURRENCY (U.S. DOLLAR) AND FUTURE EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REFLECTED IN CURRENT EARNINGS, RATHER THAN EXCLUSIVELY IN THE EQUITY SECTION OF THE BALANCE SHEET, UNTIL SUCH TIMES AS THE ECONOMY IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED HIGHLY INFLATIONARY.PRIOR TO MARCH 31, 2015, WE INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF OUR VENEZUELAN OPERATIONS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USING THE CONSOLIDATION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE COMPANY’S VENEZUELAN EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS ARE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE OF 6.30 BOLIVARS PER U.S. DOLLAR FOR THE QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. AT MARCH 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD $33.8 MILLION OF USD INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES DUE FROM ITS VENEZUELA SUBSIDIARIES, FOR HOUSEHOLD AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY IMPORTED, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING SINCE FISCAL 2010. AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 THE COMPANY’S VENEZUELA SUBSIDIARY HELD BOLIVAR DENOMINATED CASH DEPOSITS OF $93.8 MILLION OF CASH (AT THE 6.30 PER U.S. DOLLAR RATE). VENEZUELAN EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS HAVE RESULTED IN AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LACK OF EXCHANGEABILITY BETWEEN THE VENEZUELAN BOLIVAR AND U.S. DOLLAR, AND HAVE RESTRICTED OUR VENEZUELAN OPERATIONS’ ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SETTLE INTERCOMPANY OBLIGATIONS.  THE SEVERE CURRENCY CONTROLS IMPOSED BY THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS FROM EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY’S VENEZUELAN OPERATIONS AND ACCESS THE RESULTING LIQUIDITY PROVIDED BY THOSE EARNINGS.  WE EXPECT THAT THIS CONDITION WILL CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  THIS LACK OF EXCHANGEABILITY HAS RESULTED IN A LACK OF CONTROL OVER OUR VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARIES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.  THEREFORE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION 810 -- CONSOLIDATION, WE DECONSOLIDATED OUR VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARIES ON MARCH 31, 2015 AND BEGAN ACCOUNTING FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN OUR VENEZUELAN OPERATIONS USING THE COST METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. AS A RESULT OF DECONSOLIDATING OUR VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARIES, WE RECORDED A ONE-TIME CHARGE OF $144.5 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2015, WHICH HAD NO ACCOMPANYING TAX BENEFIT.  THIS CHARGE INCLUDED THE WRITE-OFF OF OUR INVESTMENT IN OUR VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARIES, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES OF $33.7 MILLION PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND THE INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES DISCUSSED ABOVE.  OUR VENEZUELAN OPERATIONS’ CASH BALANCE OF $93.8 MILLION (AT THE 6.30 PER U.S. DOLLAR RATE) AT MARCH 31, 2015 IS NO LONGER REPORTED IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. IN FUTURE PERIODS, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL NOT INCLUDE THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR VENEZUELAN OPERATIONS.  INSTEAD, WE WILL RECORD REVENUE FOR SALES OF INVENTORY TO OUR VENEZUELAN OPERATIONS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO THE EXTENT CASH IS RECEIVED. FURTHER, DIVIDENDS FROM OUR VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE RECORDED AS OTHER INCOME UPON RECEIPT OF THE CASH.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

OTHER EVENTS.  CERTAIN EVENTS RELATING TO COMPANY PENSION PLAN 
THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ITEM 1.01 AND ITEM 2.01 IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. 
EFFECTIVE AS OF 12:00 A.M. ON MARCH 1, 2016, THE COMPANY CREATED THE NEW AVON LLC PERSONAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT PLAN (THE NEW AVON PENSION
PLAN) AND IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER (AND PRIOR TO 12:01 A.M. ON MARCH 1, 2016) TRANSFERRED THE PARTICIPATION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED IN THE NORTH AMERICA BUSINESS AND CERTAIN INACTIVE AND FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY FROM
THE AVON PRODUCTS, INC. PERSONAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT PLAN (THE COMPANY PENSION PLAN) TO THE NEW AVON PENSION PLAN (SUCH TRANSFER, THE PARTICIPANT TRANSFER). SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE PARTICIPANT TRANSFER, THE COMPANY TRANSFERRED
ALL ACCRUED BENEFITS AND BENEFIT LIABILITIES UNDER THE COMPANY PENSION PLAN IN RESPECT OF INDIVIDUALS SUBJECT TO THE PARTICIPANT TRANSFER FROM THE COMPANY PENSION PLAN TO THE NEW AVON PENSION PLAN (SUCH TRANSFER, THE BENEFIT LIABILITIES
TRANSFER). IN CONNECTION WITH THE BENEFIT LIABILITIES TRANSFER, THE COMPANY HAS TRANSFERRED (AND WILL TRANSFER) CERTAIN CORRESPONDING ASSETS FROM THE COMPANY PENSION PLAN TO THE NEW AVON PENSION PLAN, WITH THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS SUBJECT TO
TRANSFER BEING DETERMINED UNDER SECTION 4044 OF EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (ERISA) AND SECTION 414(L) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED. AS A RESULT OF THE NEW AVON ISSUANCE, THE
NEW AVON PENSION PLAN AND THE LIABILITIES TRANSFERRED TO THE NEW AVON PENSION PLAN PURSUANT TO THE BENEFIT LIABILITIES TRANSFER WERE TRANSFERRED OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANYS CONTROLLED GROUP FOR PURPOSES OF ERISA. THE NEW AVON ISSUANCE ALSO
RESULTED IN THE COMPANY CEASING TO BE A MEMBER OF THE NEW AVON PENSION PLANS CONTROLLED GROUP FOR PURPOSES OF ERISA. 


THE PARTICIPANT TRANSFER REDUCED THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMPANY PENSION PLAN TO LESS THAN 80%
OF THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMPANY PENSION PLAN ON JANUARY 1, 2016. SUCH REDUCTION CONSTITUTES A REPORTABLE EVENT DESCRIBED IN SECTION 4043(C)(3) OF ERISA IN RESPECT OF THE COMPANY PENSION PLAN. THE BENEFIT LIABILITIES
TRANSFER RESULTED IN A TRANSFER OF MORE THAN 3% OF THE TOTAL BENEFIT LIABILITIES UNDER THE COMPANY PENSION PLAN TO THE NEW AVON PENSION PLAN. SUCH TRANSFER CONSTITUTES A REPORTABLE EVENT DESCRIBED IN SECTION 4043(C)(12) OF ERISA IN RESPECT OF
THE COMPANY PENSION PLAN. THE COMPANY CEASING TO BE A MEMBER OF THE NEW AVON PENSION PLANS CONTROLLED GROUP FOR PURPOSES OF ERISA WOULD CONSTITUTE A REPORTABLE EVENT DESCRIBED UNDER SECTION 4043(C)(9) OF ERISA.

WALMART RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO BUILD A DAIRY PROCESSING PLANT IN INDIANA. WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE THAT THE IMPACT OF THIS DECISION MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY 100 MILLION GALLONS OF VERY LOW-MARGIN PRIVATE-LABEL FLUID MILK VOLUME BEGINNING IN LATE 2017. GIVEN THE AMPLE LEAD TIME WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THIS DEVELOPMENT, WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WALMARTS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL IMPACT OUR SALES TO THE POTENTIALLY AFFECTED STORES OF OUR NATIONAL BRANDS, DAIRYPURE® AND TRUMOO®, OR SALES OF OUR OTHER NON-FLUID MILK PRODUCTS.
 
WEVE BEEN TALKING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL QUARTERS ABOUT OUR INCREASED FOCUS ON BUILDING AND BUYING BRANDS. WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING TO CHANGE THE MIX OF OUR BUSINESS TO INCREASE THE FOCUS ON BRANDED PRODUCTS, AND WILL CONTINUE WITH THOSE EFFORTS. WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT IN THE STRENGTH OF OUR BRANDS AND THEIR ABILITY TO COMPETE ON A NATIONAL SCALE.
 
ITS DISAPPOINTING TO LEARN OF ANY POTENTIAL LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUT WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN OUR FUTURE AND THE STRATEGIC PLAN WE RECENTLY PUT IN PLACE. WE UNDERSTAND THE FRESH DAIRY SPACE BETTER THAN ANYONE AND HAVE PROVEN THAT WE CAN MANAGE CHANGE AND WILL NAVIGATE THIS DEVELOPMENT WITH THE SAME DETERMINATION AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST. WITH MORE THAN A YEAR ADVANCE NOTICE AND THE LOW-MARGIN NATURE OF THE POTENTIAL LOST PRIVATE-LABEL MILK VOLUME, WE EXPECT TO GOVERN OUR BUSINESS SUCH THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN VERY LITTLE IMPACT TO OUR FINANCIALS SAID GREGG TANNER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER.
 
THE STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS FORM 8-K REGARDING THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF, AND OUR PLANS TO RESPOND TO, WALMARTS RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT AND OUR STRATEGY TO INCREASE OUR FOCUS ON BRANDS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING AND ARE MADE PURSUANT TO THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISION OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. THESE STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THIS FORM 8-K. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN PROJECTED OR EXPECTED IF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ERRONEOUS. THE COST AND SUPPLY OF COMMODITIES AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS ARE DETERMINED BY MARKET FORCES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED OR NO CONTROL. CUSTOMERS MAY MAKE CHANGES IN THEIR PLANS OVER WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL.  SALES, OPERATING INCOME, NET INCOME, DEBT COVENANT COMPLIANCE, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CAN VARY BASED ON A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC, GOVERNMENTAL AND COMPETITIVE FACTORS, WHICH ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE COMPANYS FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM ITS BRANDING INITIATIVES DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF ITS PRODUCTS.  ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 8-K SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FORM 8-K. THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY OBLIGATION OR UNDERTAKING TO RELEASE PUBLICLY ANY UPDATES OR REVISIONS TO ANY SUCH STATEMENTS TO REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD THERETO OR ANY CHANGES IN THE EVENTS, CONDITIONS OR CIRCUMSTANCES ON WHICH ANY SUCH STATEMENT IS BASED EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

OTHER EVENTS.ON FEBRUARY 8, 2013, VENEZUELA'S FINANCE MINISTER ANNOUNCED THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO CHANGE THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE OF THE BOLIVAR FUERTE FROM 4.30 PER U.S. DOLLAR TO 6.30 PER U.S. DOLLAR.  IT WAS ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE CURRENCY MARKET ADMINISTERED BY THE CENTRAL BANK KNOWN AS SITME THAT TRADED AT A RATE HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL RATE BY MORE THAN 100 BASIS POINTS ON AVERAGE WOULD BE ELIMINATED.  ENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC. (“ENERGIZER” OR THE “COMPANY”) EXPECTS THAT THIS CHANGE IN VALUATION WILL HAVE TWO IMMEDIATE IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FIRST, AS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY'S 10-Q FILING FOR THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY'S VENEZUELA AFFILIATES HAD APPROXIMATELY $42 MILLION OF NET MONETARY ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012.  THESE NET MONETARY ASSETS WILL BE VALUED USING THE 6.30 RATE AS OF THE DATE THAT THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT ACTION IS EFFECTIVE.  THE NET MONETARY ASSETS OF ENERGIZER'S VENEZUELA AFFILIATES FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES HAD BEEN VALUED USING THE SITME EXCHANGE RATE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF  APPROXIMATELY 5.4 BOLIVAR FUERTE PER U.S. DOLLAR AT DECEMBER 31, 2012.  BASED ON THE CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL RATE AS COMPARED TO THE SITME RATE USED FOR THE DECEMBER 31, 2012 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE CHANGE TO THE VALUE OF THE NET MONETARY ASSETS OF ITS VENEZUELA AFFILIATES WILL RESULT IN A CHARGE IN THE RANGE OF $7 TO $8 MILLION.  THIS ANTICIPATED CHARGE WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT REPORTED NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE, BUT DUE TO THE UNUSUAL NATURE OF THIS ITEM, ENERGIZER INTENDS TO EXCLUDE THIS CHARGE FROM THE COMPUTATION OF NON-GAAP ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL 2013.SECOND, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL TRANSLATE VENEZUELA OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE FINAL EIGHT MONTHS OF FISCAL 2013 AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE RATE AT WHICH VENEZUELA OPERATING RESULTS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN TRANSLATED.  IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY TRANSLATED ITS VENEZUELA OPERATING RESULTS USING AN AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 5.5 BOLIVAR FUERTE PER U.S. DOLLAR.  WE EXPECT THIS WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF VENEZUELA OPERATING RESULTS AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS QUARTER AND PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.   WE FORECAST THAT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF VENEZUELA OPERATING RESULTS WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT BOTH REPORTED AND NON-GAAP ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013 AND FUTURE PERIODS, ASSUMING AN OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE OF 6.30 BOLIVAR FUERTE PER U.S. DOLLAR.

ON FEBRUARY 14, 2013, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE COMMITTEE) OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DEAN FOODS COMPANY (THE
COMPANY) ESTABLISHED OBJECTIVES FOR 2013 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PAYMENTS PAYABLE IN 2014 TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY UNDER THE COMPANYS 2013 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN. ONLY EXECUTIVE
OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANYS FRESH DAIRY DIRECT SEGMENT AND CORPORATE REPORTING UNIT ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 2013 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN. EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE WHITEWAVE FOODS COMPANY, A
CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, PARTICIPATE IN A SEPARATE SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN.  SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE
PAYMENTS FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOR 2013 WILL BE PAID BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF COMPANY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES AND INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES FOR EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THE COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE RELATIVE WEIGHT FOR
EACH FACTOR EACH YEAR. SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR 2013 WILL BE BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF COMPANY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES FOR THAT PORTION OF THE TARGET PAYMENT TIED TO FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES, AND THE COMMITTEES
ASSESSMENT OF EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PERFORMANCE IN 2013 AGAINST THEIR INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES FOR THAT PORTION OF THE TARGET PAYMENT TIED TO INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES. THE PAYOUT FACTOR FOR THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
COMPONENT OF SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FOR EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER RANGES FROM ZERO TO 200 PERCENT OF THAT OFFICERS TARGET PAYMENT, DEPENDING ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE IN 2013 AGAINST THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES ESTABLISHED BY THE
COMMITTEE. THE PAYOUT FACTOR FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE COMPONENT OF SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FOR EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER RANGES FROM ZERO TO 200 PERCENT OF THAT OFFICERS TARGET PAYMENT, DEPENDING ON THE OFFICERS
PERFORMANCE RATING FOR 2013. THE PERFORMANCE RATING IS DETERMINED BY THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE. THE MAXIMUM TOTAL PAYOUT FOR ANY EXECUTIVE OFFICER UNDER THE FORMULAS ABOVE IS 200% OF THE
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TARGET INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITY.  THE KEY COMPANY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE FOR 2013 IS TARGETED
CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME. THE INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES INCLUDE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF STRATEGIC GOALS BASED ON EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY. THE PORTION OF THE 2013 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IS ATTACHED TO THIS FORM 8-K AS EXHIBIT 10.1, AND THIS DESCRIPTION IS QUALIFIED ENTIRELY BY REFERENCE THERETO.  RETENTION PLAN  IN ADDITION, ON FEBRUARY 14, 2013, THE COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE APPROVED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OBJECTIVES FOR THE 2013 PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE COMPANYS THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE-BASED CASH RETENTION PLAN (THE RETENTION PLAN). THE RETENTION PLAN WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ON DECEMBER 20, 2010, AND FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THE COMPANYS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K FILED ON DECEMBER 27, 2010. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED THAT AWARDS FOR THE 2013 PERFORMANCE PERIOD
WOULD BE MEASURED BASED ON ACHIEVEMENT OF THE COMPANYS OR BUSINESS UNITS STRATEGIC GROWTH PLAN FOR 2013 RELATED TO THE OFFICERS AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY. HOWEVER, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED THAT THE
PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES USED IN DETERMINING AWARDS PURSUANT TO THE RETENTION PLAN DURING THE 2013 PERFORMANCE PERIOD WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES FOR SHORT TERM-INCENTIVE PAYMENTS, GENERALLY CONSISTING OF ADJUSTED
OPERATING INCOME AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FOR THE 2013 PERFORMANCE PERIOD, PAYOUTS RANGE FROM ZERO TO 100 PERCENT OF TARGET PAYOUT BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCH PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES, WITH A MAXIMUM PAYOUT EQUAL TO 100% OF THE TARGET AMOUNT THAT SUCH
EXECUTIVE OFFICER MAY RECEIVE PURSUANT TO THE SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN DESCRIBED ABOVE. ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE MEASURED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. EXECUTIVE OFFICERS MUST BE EMPLOYED THROUGH JUNE 24, 2014 IN
ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FOR 2013 AWARDS. 


ALTHOUGH THE RETENTION PLAN ORIGINALLY INCLUDED GREGG TANNER, THE COMPANYS CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AS A PARTICIPANT, MR. TANNER VOLUNTARILY REMOVED HIMSELF AS A PARTICIPANT FROM THE PLAN FOR THE 2013 PERFORMANCE PERIOD UPON APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IN FEBRUARY 2013.

IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE DISTRIBUTION. THE 



ADJUSTMENT WILL BE EFFECTED BASED ON A FORMULA USING THE VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE WHITEWAVE CLASS A COMMON STOCK DURING THE FIVE TRADING PERIOD ENDED ON THE
SECOND TRADING DAY PRECEDING THE DISTRIBUTION TO DETERMINE THE PRE-DISTRIBUTION VALUE AND THE VALUE OF THE DISTRIBUTION TO STOCKHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, WITH RESPECT TO UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND UNVESTED PHANTOM STOCK UNITS HELD BY DEAN FOODS
CONTINUING DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES, THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OUTSTANDING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND PHANTOM STOCK UNITS WILL BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE DEAN FOODS COMMON STOCK (DETERMINED USING THE SAME VOLUME WEIGHTED
AVERAGE VALUES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) AS A RESULT OF THE DISTRIBUTION IN A MANNER THAT, ON A UNIT-BY-UNIT BASIS, PRESERVES THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF EACH OUTSTANDING RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT OR PHANTOM STOCK UNIT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE TO
ENSURE THERE IS NO ENHANCEMENT OR DIMINUTION IN THE RIGHTS CONVEYED BY VESTED AND UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS, UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND UNVESTED PHANTOM STOCK UNITS AS A RESULT OF THE DISTRIBUTION. 
ALL OUTSTANDING VESTED AND UNVESTED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF DEAN FOODS COMMON STOCK, UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND UNVESTED
PHANTOM STOCK UNITS HELD BY DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES OF WHITEWAVE FOLLOWING THE DISTRIBUTION (WHITEWAVE DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES) WILL ALSO BE CONVERTED, FOLLOWING THE DISTRIBUTION, INTO RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF WHITEWAVE CLASS A COMMON
STOCK. THE OPTIONS TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK HELD BY WHITEWAVE DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES WILL BE CONVERTED TO OPTIONS TO PURCHASE THE CLASS A COMMON STOCK OF WHITEWAVE IN A MANNER THAT PRESERVES THE AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE IN THE CONVERTED
OPTION AND CONTINUES THE SAME PROPORTIONATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXERCISE PRICE AND THE VALUE OF THE WHITEWAVE CLASS A COMMON STOCK AS EXISTED WITH RESPECT TO THE DEAN FOODS COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE DISTRIBUTION. THE ADJUSTMENT
WILL BE EFFECTED BASED ON A FORMULA USING THE VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE WHITEWAVE CLASS A COMMON STOCK DURING THE FIVE TRADING PERIOD ENDED ON THE SECOND TRADING DAY PRECEDING THE DISTRIBUTION. IN ADDITION, THE
UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND UNVESTED PHANTOM STOCK UNITS HELD BY WHITEWAVE DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES WILL BE CONVERTED TO WHITEWAVE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND PHANTOM STOCK UNITS IN A MANNER THAT, ON A UNIT-BY-UNIT BASIS, PRESERVES THE
INTRINSIC VALUE OF EACH OUTSTANDING RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT OR PHANTOM STOCK UNIT (DETERMINED USING THE SAME VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE VALUES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE). THE PURPOSE OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS TO ASSURE THAT THE WHITEWAVE DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES
WILL HAVE THEIR EQUITY INCENTIVES LINKED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF WHITEWAVES COMMON STOCK ON A BASIS THAT ENSURES THERE IS NO ENHANCEMENT OR DIMINUTION IN THE RIGHTS CONVEYED BY THE CONVERTED STOCK OPTIONS AND UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND
PHANTOM STOCK UNITS AS A RESULT OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND THE CONVERSION INTO WHITEWAVE AWARDS.

(THE “COMPANY”) APPROVED ADDITIONAL ACTIONS RELATING TO ITS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED $400 MILLION COST SAVINGS INITIATIVE (“$400M COST SAVINGS INITIATIVE”).  THESE ACTIONS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF GLOBAL HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY’S SERVICE MODEL TRANSFORMATION (“SMT”) PROJECT AS DESCRIBED BELOW, IN ADDITION TO REDUCTIONS IN HEADCOUNT IN NORTH AMERICA TAKEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.   THESE ACTIONS IN THE AGGREGATE ARE EXPECTED TO BE LARGELY COMPLETED BEFORE THE END OF 2014.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD TOTAL CHARGES RELATED TO THESE ACTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION TO $45 MILLION BEFORE TAXES.  APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION OF THESE CHARGES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, WITH THE REMAINDER EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED BEFORE THE END OF 2014.  THESE CHARGES ARE COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 650 POSITIONS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE FUTURE CASH EXPENDITURES.IN CONNECTION WITH THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WE EXPECT TO REALIZE ANNUALIZED SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION TO $45 MILLION BEFORE TAXES AS PART OF THE $400M COST SAVINGS INITIATIVE. ITEM 2.06    MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS.ON DECEMBER 9, 2013, THE COMPANY DECIDED TO HALT FURTHER ROLL-OUT OF THE COMPANY’S SMT PROJECT.  SMT WAS A GLOBAL PROGRAM INITIATED IN 2009 TO IMPROVE THE COMPANY’S ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND ENABLE CHANGES TO THE WAY REPRESENTATIVES INTERACT WITH THE COMPANY.  EARLIER IN 2013, SMT WAS PILOTED IN CANADA, CAUSING SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS DISRUPTION IN THAT MARKET, AND DID NOT SHOW A CLEAR RETURN ON INVESTMENT.  THIS DECISION TO HALT THE FURTHER ROLL-OUT OF SMT WAS MADE IN LIGHT OF THE POTENTIAL RISK OF FURTHER DISRUPTION.  THE COMPANY’S CURRENT FOCUS IS ON STABILIZING AND GROWING THE BUSINESS AND IMPROVING OPERATING CAPABILITY, WHICH INCLUDES UPDATING IT INFRASTRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT DELIVERS CLEAR RETURN ON INVESTMENT.   THE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE OF THE CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE ASSOCIATED WITH SMT (“SMT ASSET”) IS APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO USE THE SMT ASSET IN THE PILOT MARKET OF CANADA.  AS CANADA WILL BE THE ONLY MARKET USING THE SMT ASSET, THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT TO CONSIDER THE CASH FLOWS OF THE CANADIAN BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES THE ONGOING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMT.  THESE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SMT ASSET.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD A PRE-TAX NON-CASH CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION TO $125 MILLION, REFLECTING THE WRITE-DOWN OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013.  THIS IMPAIRMENT WILL BE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL EXPENSES.

(E) ON NOVEMBER 12, 2014, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS (OUR BOARD) AMENDED THE DEAN FOODS COMPANY 2007 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2007
PLAN) TO PROVIDE FOR A SO-CALLED DOUBLE-TRIGGER CHANGE-IN-CONTROL VESTING PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO EQUITY AWARDS OF THE COMPANY GRANTED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2014. PURSUANT TO THIS AMENDMENT, ANY AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE 2007
PLAN AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2014 WILL NOT BECOME VESTED AND PAYABLE UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL (AS DEFINED IN THE PLAN), SO LONG AS THE AWARDS CONTINUE IN EFFECT ON TERMS THAT ARE NO LESS FAVORABLE THAN WERE APPLICABLE IMMEDIATELY
PRIOR TO CHANGE IN CONTROL AND PROVIDE THAT SUCH AWARDS WILL VEST IN FULL IF THE COMPANY OR ITS SUCCESSOR TERMINATES THE EMPLOYEES EMPLOYMENT INVOLUNTARILY (OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE) OR CONSTRUCTIVELY WITHIN 24 MONTHS AFTER THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.
AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2015 WILL CONTINUE TO VEST AND, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, BECOME PAYABLE OR EXERCISABLE UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, AS PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THOSE AWARDS AS
ORIGINALLY GRANTED.  AS AMENDED, THE 2007 PLAN PROVIDES THAT, IF ANY POST-2014 AWARDS WILL NOT CONTINUE IN EFFECT FOLLOWING THE CHANGE IN
CONTROL ON THE TERMS REFERENCED ABOVE, WHETHER BECAUSE THE ACQUIRING ENTITY DECIDES NOT TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE SUBSTITUTE AWARDS OR BECAUSE THE REQUISITE CONDITIONS TO PRESERVE THE EXISTING TERMS OF THESE AWARDS ARE NOT MET, THE EFFECTED AWARDS WILL
VEST IN FULL, AND GENERALLY BECOME PAYABLE, UPON THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.  OUR BOARD DETERMINED TO AMEND THE 2007 PLAN AS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN
RESPONSE TO EVOLVING MARKET PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO EQUITY COMPENSATION AND SHAREHOLDER INPUT PROVIDED AT OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS. A GROWING NUMBER OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING SEVERAL OF OUR PEER COMPANIES NOW PROVIDE THAT,
RATHER THAN BECOMING VESTED AND PAYABLE UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, MANAGEMENT EQUITY AWARDS WILL CONTINUE IN EFFECT SO LONG AS THE AWARDS ARE CONTINUED ON FAIR AND APPROPRIATE TERMS. 
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE 2007 PLAN, AS AMENDED, IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE 2007 PLAN,
WHICH IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 10.1 AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.
