ON MARCH 2, 2015, WE ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2014.  A COPY OF THAT RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS DISCLOSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
 
WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE RELEASE.  WE ALSO PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, NON-CASH CHARGES AND OTHER NON-OPERATIONAL ITEMS AND THE RELATED EARNINGS (LOSSES) PER SHARE IMPACT OF SUCH CHARGES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2014. THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS THAT ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF NON-CASH CHARGES AND OTHER NON-OPERATIONAL ITEMS FROM INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDED A SCHEDULE OF THE NON-CASH CHARGES AND OTHER NON-OPERATIONAL ITEMS RECORDED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, AND THEIR RELATED EARNINGS (LOSSES) PER SHARE IMPACT IN CALCULATING ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX.
 
WE INCLUDED THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THE RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, CERTAIN LIMITATIONS TO THESE MEASURES AND THEREFORE THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO AND NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OUR RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

(THE ""COMPANY""), ALL AS DETERMINED OR RECOMMENDED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE ""COMMITTEE"") OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE ""BOARD""), AND, AS APPROPRIATE, RATIFIED BY THE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD.  THESE 2015 EQUITY GRANTS DIFFER TO ONLY A MINOR DEGREE FROM SIMILAR GRANTS MADE IN JANUARY 2014, IN THAT THE VESTING SCHEDULE OF TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM CLIFF VESTING AT THE END OF THREE YEARS TO ANNUAL RATABLE VESTING OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD.THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OF 100% TARGET-LEVEL EQUITY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FOR 2015 GRANTED TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IS UNCHANGED FROM THE LEVEL OF THESE GRANTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AND IS $4,000,000 FOR MR.

IN REVIEWING THE 2015 GRANTS, THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZED THAT ALTHOUGH THE MONETARY VALUE OF THE LONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS DID NOT CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR LEVEL, AT THE CURRENT COMMON STOCK PRICE THE NUMBER OF SHARES REQUIRED TO BE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE TO MR. RYKHOEK WOULD EXCEED THE 500,000 SHARE LIMIT.  IN ADDITION, TWO-THIRDS OF MR. RYKHOEK'S LONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS ARE PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS THAT PROVIDE FOR RECEIPT OF UP TO 200% OF THE TARGET LEVEL NUMBER OF SHARES IF EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE LEVELS ARE ACHIEVED.  AS A RESULT, THE COMMITTEE HAS MADE THE AWARDS OF PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED SHARES TO MR. RYKHOEK SUBJECT TO STOCKHOLDERS APPROVING AN INCREASE IN THE LIMITS ON GRANTS TO A SINGLE NEO AT THE COMPANY'S MAY 2015 ANNUAL STOCKHOLDERS MEETING (THE ""INCENTIVE PLAN STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"").THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUED OR TO BE ISSUED UNDER THESE INCENTIVE AWARDS AT THE TARGET LEVEL BASED ON THE JANUARY 9, 2015 GRANT DATE CLOSING PRICE FOR THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE NYSE OF $7.31.

ON APRIL 21, 2015, WE ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2015.  A COPY OF THAT RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.
 
THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.  SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS DISCLOSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
 
WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE RELEASE. THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS THAT ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.

ITEM 5.07                                           SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
 
 
THE COMPANYS ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS WAS HELD ON JUNE 2, 2015.  HOLDERS OF 290,612,166 SHARES, REPRESENTING 88.18% OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ENTITLED TO VOTE AS OF THE RECORD DATE FOR THE MEETING, PARTICIPATED IN PERSON OR BY PROXY.
 
AS EXPLAINED IN OUR PROXY STATEMENT RELATING TO THE MEETING:
 
·                  DIRECTORS ARE ELECTED BY A PLURALITY OF THE VOTES CAST.  IN THE EVENT A NOMINEE DOES NOT RECEIVE THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES VOTED IN CONNECTION WITH HIS ELECTION, HE MUST PROMPTLY TENDER HIS RESIGNATION FROM THE BOARD, WHICH THE BOARD WILL ACCEPT UNLESS IT DETERMINES THAT IT WOULD NOT BE IN THE COMPANYS BEST INTERESTS TO DO SO.*
 
·                  APPROVAL OF THE OTHER MATTERS CONSIDERED AT THE MEETING REQUIRED THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF THE HOLDERS OF A MAJORITY OF SHARES PRESENT IN PERSON OR REPRESENTED BY PROXY AND ENTITLED TO VOTE AT THE MEETING, WITH ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NONVOTES HAVING THE EFFECT OF VOTES AGAINST A PROPOSAL. HOWEVER, AS NOTED BELOW, SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AT THE MEETING AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANYS BYE-LAWS THAT CHANGED THE VOTING STANDARD SUCH THAT APPROVAL OF THE REMAINING MATTERS REQUIRED THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF THE HOLDERS OF A MAJORITY OF SHARES PRESENT IN PERSON OR REPRESENTED BY PROXY AND ENTITLED TO VOTE ON THE MATTER, WITH ABSTENTIONS HAVING THE EFFECT OF VOTES AGAINST A PROPOSAL AND BROKER NONVOTES BEING DISREGARDED IN THE CALCULATION.

* MESSRS. CRANE, LINN, WOLF AND YEARWOOD RECEIVED THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES VOTED (OR WITHHELD) IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ELECTION AND ACCORDINGLY TENDERED THEIR RESIGNATIONS.  THE GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD CONSIDERED THE CURRENT STRUCTURE AND NEEDS OF THE BOARD, THE COMPANYS CURRENT STRATEGIC NEEDS, SHAREHOLDERS EXPRESSED REASONS FOR WITHHOLDING VOTES, ACTUAL VOTE COUNTS AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND ANTICIPATED ROLES OF EACH OF MESSRS. CRANE, LINN, WOLF AND YEARWOOD AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE BOARD NOT ACCEPT THE RESIGNATIONS.  THE BOARD DETERMINED THAT ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR RESIGNATIONS WOULD NOT BE IN THE COMPANYS BEST INTERESTS AND VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO REJECT THE RESIGNATIONS.  MESSRS. CRANE, LINN, WOLF AND YEARWOOD DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE DELIBERATIONS OR THE VOTE.
 
MESSRS. CRANE, LINN, WOLF AND YEARWOOD (THE TENDERING DIRECTORS) HAVE BEEN DIRECTORS SINCE 2012, 2012, 2013 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.  THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE COMPANYS ENHANCED STRATEGIC FOCUS AND IMPROVED MARKET POSITION.  BEGINNING IN 2013, THE BOARD UNDERTOOK A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIC REVIEW PROCESS AIMED AT UNLOCKING LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND IMPROVING CORE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE.  THAT REVIEW CULMINATED IN THE CLOSING OF A MERGER TRANSACTION THIS YEAR THAT COMBINED THE COMPANYS COMPLETION & PRODUCTION SERVICES BUSINESS LINE WITH C&J ENERGY SERVICES, INC., WHICH BOTH IMPROVED THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND TRANSFORMED THE COMPANY INTO A PURE-PLAY DRILLING BUSINESS WITH A 53% EQUITY INTEREST IN A LARGER, MORE FOCUSED PUBLIC COMPANY IN THE COMPLETION AND PRODUCTION SERVICES SPACE.  EACH OF THE TENDERING DIRECTORS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE STRATEGIC REVIEW PROCESS, WHICH SPANNED A PERIOD OF NEARLY TWO YEARS AND INVOLVED CONSIDERABLE ANALYSIS, DEBATE AND EVALUATION OF A MYRIAD OF COMPLEX OPPORTUNITIES AND ALTERNATIVES.  IN FACT, MR. WOLF WAS INITIALLY NOMINATED BY OUR THEN-LARGEST SHAREHOLDER SPECIFICALLY IN ANTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC REVIEW PROCESS.  THE OTHER TENDERING DIRECTORS OFFERED UNIQUE AND VALUABLE INSIGHTS BASED UPON THEIR RESPECTIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY.
 
FURTHER, THE TENDERING DIRECTORS ACTIONS HAVE DIRECTLY RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENTS TO THE COMPANYS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND, IN PARTICULAR, EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PRACTICES.  THEY WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN IMPLEMENTING THE DRASTIC CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION WHICH NOW PLACE THE COMPANY WITHIN THE RANGE OF COMPARABLE OILFIELD SERVICES COMPANIES IN TERMS OF MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION LEVELS, A COMPENSATION STRUCTURE THAT WAS APPROVED BY OVER 65% OF SHAREHOLDERS VOTING AT THE MEETING.  AS MEMBERS OF THE COMPENSATION OR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES, MESSRS. LINN, YEARWOOD AND CRANE EACH PLAYED SIGNIFICANT LEADERSHIP ROLES IN EFFECTING THOSE CHANGES (WHICH PREDATED MR. WOLFS APPOINTMENT TO THE BOARD).
 
FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM SHAREHOLDERS REVEALED THREE SEPARATE REASONS UNDERLYING THE WITHHOLD VOTES FOR THE TENDERING DIRECTORS, EACH OF WHICH WAS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD IN DECLINING TO ACCEPT THE RESIGNATIONS.  FIRST, SEVERAL INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDERS VOTING POLICIES CALL FOR THEIR SHARES TO BE AUTOMATICALLY VOTED SOLELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF CERTAIN PROXY ADVISORY SERVICES, MOST NOTABLY ISS AND GLASS LEWIS, EACH OF WHICH RECOMMENDED WITHHOLD VOTES FOR THE TENDERING DIRECTORS. OTHERS SUBSCRIBE TO THOSE SERVICES, BUT RETAIN VARYING LEVELS OF DISCRETION INTERNALLY IN VOTING THEIR SHARES.  SECOND, SOME SHAREHOLDERS INDICATED CONCERNS REGARDING MR. CRANES INDEPENDENCE, BASED PRIMARILY UPON PROXY ADVISORY SERVICE COMMENTARY AND THE COMPANYS PROXY DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY TO COMPANIES AFFILIATED WITH CRANE CAPITAL GROUP (CCG), AN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY OF WHICH MR. CRANE IS CHAIRMAN AND CEO. FINALLY, THE OTHER TENDERING DIRECTORS ARE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE, AND THE WITHHOLD VOTES APPEAR MOTIVATED BY CONCERNS RELATED TO RESPONSIVENESS TO SHAREHOLDER CONCERNS.
 
3





 
BASED UPON AVAILABLE DATA, THE BOARD ESTIMATES THAT ONE-THIRD OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS SHAREHOLDINGS ARE AUTOMATICALLY VOTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROXY ADVISORY SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS.  AN ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THOSE HOLDINGS ARE INFLUENCED BY SUCH RECOMMENDATIONS.  THE BOARD CONCLUDED, HOWEVER, THAT MANY OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS, INCLUDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING DIRECTORS, ARE BASED UPON FLAWED OR INACCURATE INFORMATION, AND IN SOME CASES GIVE UNDUE WEIGHT TO ISSUES THAT ARE OF LESSER RELATIVE IMPORTANCE IN EVALUATING THE SERVICE OF THOSE DIRECTORS.  CONTRIBUTING TO THIS PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT GLASS LEWIS DOES NOT MAKE ITS RECOMMENDATIONS AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY AND REFUSES TO AFFORD THE COMPANY THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND OR COMMENT UPON ANY CONCERNS IT MAY HAVE.  ISS DOES ALLOW THE COMPANY TO REVIEW ITS RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT IT ALLOWS COMMENTS BASED ONLY UPON FACTUAL ERRORS AND, IN THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE, FAILS TO CORRECT ALL FACTUAL ERRORS AND DOES NOT ADDRESS COMMENTS THAT RELATE TO OMITTED OR SKEWED INFORMATION.  AS SUCH, IN CONSIDERING THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON DIRECTORS, THE BOARD QUESTIONED WHETHER A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE WITHHOLD VOTES ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ACTUAL PREFERENCES OF SHAREHOLDERS WHOSE VOTES ARE AUTOMATICALLY VOTED AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OF SHAREHOLDERS WHO MAY HAVE RELIED UPON FLAWED OR INACCURATE STATEMENTS BY THE PROXY ADVISORY SERVICES.
 
WITH RESPECT TO MR. CRANE, THE PRIMARY CONCERN MOTIVATING WITHHOLD VOTES, AS EXPRESSED BY INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS AND PROXY ADVISORY SERVICES, WAS THAT THE VOLUME OF PAYMENTS FOR SERVICES TO CCG COMPANIES MAY CAUSE MR. CRANE NOT TO BE INDEPENDENT FROM MANAGEMENT.  EACH YEAR, THE BOARD CONSIDERS MR. CRANES INDEPENDENCE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE AMOUNTS OF PAYMENTS FROM THE COMPANY TO CCG COMPANIES, AND HAS CONSISTENTLY CONCLUDED THAT MR. CRANE IS INDEPENDENT.  FOR 2014, THE COMPANY REPORTED PAYMENTS TO CCG TOTALING $89.1 MILLION, WHICH IS A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF BOTH THE COMPANYS AND CCGS REVENUES THAT FALLS SQUARELY WITHIN THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NYSE) OBJECTIVE INDEPENDENCE CRITERIA.  BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY CCG (LOGISTICS AND ELECTRICITY), A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE PAYMENTS CONSTITUTES REIMBURSEMENT FOR PAYMENTS TO UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES, PARTICULARLY FOR FREIGHT FORWARDING AND CUSTOMS SERVICES.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY OVERSTATES THE NET PAYMENTS RETAINED BY CCG FOR SERVICES.  FURTHERMORE, THE PRICING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CCG ARE EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.  THE BOARD CONSIDERED BOTH THE GROSS AND NET PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS THE ARMS-LENGTH NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP, IN CONCLUDING THAT MR. CRANE IS INDEPENDENT UNDER THE NYSE SUBJECTIVE REQUIREMENTS.  REAFFIRMING MR. CRANES INDEPENDENCE, AND CONSIDERING HIS SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BOARD OUTLINED ABOVE AND IN THE COMPANYS PROXY STATEMENT, THE BOARD CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY TO ACCEPT MR. CRANES RESIGNATION.
 
FOR THE REMAINING TENDERING DIRECTORS, THE PRIMARY CONCERN MOTIVATING WITHHOLD VOTES, AS EXPRESSED BY INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS AND PROXY ADVISORY SERVICES, WAS A LACK OF RESPONSIVENESS BY THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE TO PRIOR SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY VOTES.  THE BOARD REVIEWED AND WEIGHED THOSE VOTES, THE RESPONSES THERETO, AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BOARD OF EACH OF THE TENDERING DIRECTORS.  SHAREHOLDERS VOTED AGAINST THE BOARDS RECOMMENDATION ON FOUR ITEMS AT THE 2014 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.  THE BOARDS RESPONSE TO EACH OF THE ADVISORY ITEMS IS DETAILED IN THE COMPANYS 2015 PROXY STATEMENT, WITH FURTHER ACTION TAKEN REFLECTED IN THE FOLLOWING CHART:

FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS  


SAY-ON-PAY 

  

SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED SAY-ON-PAY AT THE 2015 ANNUAL   GENERAL MEETING WITH NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE VOTE, AFFIRMING THE ADEQUACY OF   THE BOARDS RESPONSE.  


EXTENSION OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN 

  

THE BOARD ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO ALLOW THE PLAN TO   EXPIRE AT THE END OF ITS CURRENT TERM, THEREBY IMPLEMENTING THE RESULTS OF   THE VOTE.

BROKER NONVOTES 

  

THE BOARD PRESENTED, AND SHAREHOLDERS PASSED AT THE   2015 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING, A BYE-LAW AMENDMENT TO EFFECT THE BROKER NONVOTE   CHANGE REQUESTED BY SHAREHOLDERS.  


MAJORITY VOTE FOR DIRECTORS 

  

THE BOARD CHANGED THE COMPOSITION OF ITS COMMITTEES   AND ADOPTED A POLICY REQUIRING PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE BOARDS REASONING   IF ANY RESIGNATION TENDERED PURSUANT TO THE DIRECTOR RESIGNATION POLICY IS   NOT ACCEPTED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD HAS TURNED OVER COMPLETELY   IN THE PAST 5 YEARS, ADDRESSING THE BOARD ENTRENCHMENT CONCERN THAT UNDERLIES   THIS ISSUE. THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON THIS TOPIC WAS WITHDRAWN IN 2015.   
 
IN ADDITION, AT THE 2015 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING, A MAJORITY OF SHAREHOLDERS VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE PROXY ACCESS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL.  THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE HAD PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED A PROXY ACCESS POLICY, ONE OF THE FIRST PUBLIC COMPANIES TO DO SO, AND COMMITTED TO CONSIDER IN 2017 REDUCING THE SHARE OWNERSHIP REQUIRED TO NOMINATE A DIRECTOR UNDER THAT POLICY.  IN LIGHT OF THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE AT THE MEETING, THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE COMMITTED TO CONDUCT THAT REVIEW IN ADVANCE OF THE 2016 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.  ALTHOUGH OTHER SHAREHOLDER CONCERNS WERE CITED BY SOME SHAREHOLDERS AND PROXY ADVISORY SERVICES, THE BOARD OBSERVED THAT THOSE CONCERNS WERE NOT SHARED BY A MAJORITY OF SHAREHOLDERS.  THE BOARD CONCLUDED THAT THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE HAD ADEQUATELY RESPONDED TO CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY A MAJORITY OF SHAREHOLDERS.
 
THE BOARD ALSO CONSIDERED THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE, AS WELL AS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE TENDERING DIRECTORS GENERALLY, BEYOND THOSE DISCUSSED ABOVE.  AMONG THE CONTRIBUTIONS DISCUSSED BY THE BOARD WERE EXECUTION OF THE C&J ENERGY TRANSACTION, THE HIRING OF THE COMPANYS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, THE ELIMINATION OF A STAGGERED BOARD IN RESPONSE TO SHAREHOLDERS CONCERNS, AND OVERHAULING THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE.  IN ADDITION, THE BOARD NOTED THAT NEARLY THE ENTIRE BOARD HAS TURNED OVER SINCE THE DEPARTURE OF THE PREVIOUS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MR. ISENBERG.  NOT ONLY HAS THAT ELIMINATED HISTORICALLY PERVASIVE CONCERNS OF DIRECTOR ENTRENCHMENT, THE CURRENT DIRECTORS ARE ALL RESPECTED LEADERS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRY.  IN PARTICULAR, THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE, AS WELL AS THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MR. YEARWOOD (THE LEAD DIRECTOR), HAS IMPLEMENTED A SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE COMPARED TO THE COMPANYS PEERS.  IN ADDITION TO THE BOARDS ADOPTION LAST YEAR OF A PROXY ACCESS POLICY, ONE OF THE FIRST IMPLEMENTED BY A PUBLIC COMPANY AS NOTED ABOVE, OVER 28% OF THE BOARD IS CURRENTLY COMPRISED OF DIRECTORS NOMINATED BY A SHAREHOLDER.  THE BOARD ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE COMPANY HAS IMPROVED ITS RELATIVE SHARE PERFORMANCE UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE TENDERING DIRECTORS.
 
AFTER WEIGHING ALL OF THE FOREGOING FACTORS, THE BOARD CONCLUDED THAT ACCEPTING THE RESIGNATIONS OF THE TENDERING DIRECTORS WAS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY, AND IT DECLINED TO DO SO.

      MAINE AND ATLANTIC CANADA CO. (“MMAC”), AND THE MONITOR (THE “MONITOR”)
      IN MMAC’S CANADIAN BANKRUPTCY (COLLECTIVELY, THE “MMA PARTIES”) TO
      RESOLVE CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE JULY 2013 TRAIN DERAILMENT IN
      LAC-MÉGANTIC, QUEBEC (THE “DERAILMENT”).  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE
      SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WILL CONTRIBUTE US$110 MILLION (THE
      “SETTLEMENT PAYMENT”) TO A COMPENSATION FUND ESTABLISHED TO COMPENSATE
      PARTIES WHO SUFFERED LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE DERAILMENT.  THE COMPANY

      BY INSURANCE.  AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES
      WILL ALSO ASSIGN TO THE TRUSTEE AND MMAC CERTAIN CLAIMS THEY HAVE
      AGAINST THIRD PARTIES ARISING OUT OF THE DERAILMENT.

      APPROVED BY CREDITORS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND CANADIAN BANKRUPTCIES, AS
      WELL AS THE U.S. AND CANADIAN BANKRUPTCY COURTS. THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC
      AND OTHER KEY CREDITORS IN THE BANKRUPTCIES HAVE CONSENTED TO THE
      SETTLEMENT. THE PLANS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE BY THIRD PARTIES. AS
      A RESULT, APPROVAL OF THE PLANS, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SETTLEMENT
      AGREEMENT AND THE RELATED TIMING IS UNCERTAIN.

BEEN REDUCED BY 37.5% AS COMPARED TO HIS 2014 TARGET OPPORTUNITY.  THE QUANTITATIVE PORTION OF THE BONUS PROVIDES FOR MINIMUM, TARGET AND
MAXIMUM PAYOUT LEVELS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALARY, BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF 87%, 100% AND 113% OF THE EBITDA TARGET. IF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OCCURS AT A LEVEL IN BETWEEN THESE FACTORS, A SLIDING SCALE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE
PAYOUT FACTOR.  WITH RESPECT TO THE QUALITATIVE PORTION, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS APPROVED EXECUTIVE TEAM OBJECTIVES RELATING TO THE
FOLLOWING: REDUCING OVERHEAD COSTS IN THE COMPANY, INCREASING WORKING CAPITAL AND INTERNATIONAL REVENUE GROWTH, AND IMPROVING THE CULTURE AND COMPLIANCE OF THE COMPANY. THE COMMITTEE WILL EVALUATE THE EXECUTIVE TEAMS ACHIEVEMENTS WITH RESPECT

AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
 
WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE RELEASE. THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS THAT ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, CERTAIN LIMITATIONS TO THESE MEASURES AND THEREFORE THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO AND NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OUR RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.  SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS DISCLOSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
 
WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE RELEASE. THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS THAT ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM OUR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, CERTAIN LIMITATIONS TO THESE MEASURES AND THEREFORE THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO AND NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OUR RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

ON FEBRUARY 16, 2016, WE ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE- AND TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015.  A COPY OF THAT RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.
 
THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.  SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS DISCLOSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
 
WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE RELEASE. THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS THAT ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING EXPENSES FROM OPERATING REVENUES.  ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM OPERATING REVENUES. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) IN THE PRESS RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ACCURATELY REFLECT OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY.  IN ADDITION, SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS USE THESE MEASURES OF US AS METRICS ON WHICH THEY ANALYZE OUR PERFORMANCE.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, CERTAIN LIMITATIONS TO THESE MEASURES AND THEREFORE THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO AND NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OUR RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

(THE ""COMPANY"") ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNCHANGED FROM 2015 LEVELS.  HOWEVER, REVISIONS TO THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS WERE MADE BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE “COMMITTEE”) OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE “BOARD”) OF THE COMPANY TO ACCOMMODATE (I) THE LIMITED NUMBER OF SHARES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR ONGOING ISSUANCE UNDER THE COMPANY'S 2004 OMNIBUS STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLAN (AS AMENDED AND RESTATED) (THE ""PLAN"") AND (II) THE NEED TO REPLACE THE GROWTH AND INCOME PERFORMANCE-BASED EQUITY AWARDS USED IN 2014 AND 2015 IN LIGHT OF THE COMPANY’S SUSPENSION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN LATE 2015.THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS CHANGES TO THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD ALLOCATIONS TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOR 2016, WITH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BEING (I) THE SUBSTITUTION OF A NEW OIL PRICE CHANGE VS TSR PERFORMANCE-BASED CASH AWARD FOR THE GROWTH AND INCOME PERFORMANCE-BASED EQUITY AWARD GRANTED IN 2014 AND 2015 AND (II) FOR 2016 PERFORMANCE-BASED EQUITY AWARDS, PROVIDING THAT ANY AMOUNTS EARNED UNDER THE STOCK TSR AND CAPITAL EFFICIENCY PERFORMANCE-BASED EQUITY AWARDS ABOVE THE 100% TARGET LEVELS WILL BE PAYABLE IN CASH, RATHER THAN IN SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK, IN ORDER TO CONSERVE AVAILABLE SHARES UNDER THE PLAN.AWARD 2015 2016STOCK TSR PERFORMANCE-BASED EQUITY AWARD 33% 25%OIL PRICE CHANGE VS TSR PERFORMANCE-BASED CASH AWARD — 25%GROWTH AND INCOME PERFORMANCE-BASED EQUITY AWARD 22% —CAPITAL EFFICIENCY PERFORMANCE-BASED EQUITY AWARD 11% 10%ANTICIPATED TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK EQUITY AWARD (1) 34% 40%TOTAL 100% 100%(1)IT IS CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS FOR 2016 WILL BE GRANTED MID-YEAR TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND ALL EMPLOYEES, RATABLY VESTING OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD; HOWEVER, THESE AWARDS HAVE YET TO BE DETERMINED OR APPROVED BY THE COMMITTEE.THE NEW OIL PRICE CHANGE VS TSR PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARD COMPARES THE CHANGE IN OIL PRICES TO THE COMPANY’S TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, BOTH OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD, WITH THE AWARD TO BE PAYABLE IN CASH IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF SHARES UTILIZED UNDER GRANTS OF THIS NEW AWARD AND TO REDUCE THE MARK-TO-MARKET VOLATILITY OF THIS TYPE OF AWARD IF ISSUED IN EQUITY.  AS THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE IS INFLUENCED HEAVILY BY FLUCTUATIONS IN OIL PRICES (APPROXIMATELY 95% OF THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTION IS OIL), THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT COMPARING THE COMPANY’S STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE TO THE CHANGE IN OIL PRICES IS A REASONABLE METRIC TO JUDGE THE COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE.AS AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE TO MANAGE AND CONSERVE SHARES AVAILABLE UNDER THE PLAN, THE COMMITTEE SET A STOCK PRICE FLOOR OF $2.25 PER SHARE IN DETERMINING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES THAT WOULD BE GRANTED AS PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS ON JANUARY 4, 2016, RESULTING IN LOWER COMPENSATION THAN IF THE ACTUAL NYSE CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON JANUARY 4, 2016 OF $2.04 PER SHARE HAD BEEN USED.BASED ON THE CHANGES OUTLINED ABOVE, ON JANUARY 4, 2016, THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS WERE GRANTED TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, ALL AS DETERMINED OR RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE, AND, AS APPROPRIATE, RATIFIED BY THE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD.  THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE CASH AMOUNT OR NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED UNDER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS AT THE TARGET LEVEL FOR THE (I) OIL PRICE CHANGE VS TSR AWARD (PAYABLE IN CASH), (II) CAPITAL EFFICIENCY AWARD (PAYABLE IN COMMON STOCK) AND (III) STOCK TSR AWARD (PAYABLE IN COMMON STOCK).

ON APRIL 25, 2016, WE ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2016.  A COPY OF THAT RELEASE IS FURNISHED HEREWITH AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.
 
THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.  SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS DISCLOSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
 
WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE RELEASE. THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS THAT ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING EXPENSES FROM OPERATING REVENUES.  ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM OPERATING REVENUES. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) IN THE PRESS RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ACCURATELY REFLECT OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS USE THIS MEASURE AS ONE OF THE METRICS ON WHICH THEY ANALYZE OUR PERFORMANCE.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, CERTAIN LIMITATIONS TO THESE MEASURES AND THEREFORE THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO AND NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OUR RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

* MESSRS. LINN, WOLF AND YEARWOOD RECEIVED THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES VOTED (OR WITHHELD) IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ELECTION AND ACCORDINGLY TENDERED THEIR RESIGNATIONS.  A SPECIALLY APPOINTED GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD, COMPRISED OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS RECEIVING THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF GREATER THAN A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES VOTED, CONSIDERED THE CURRENT STRUCTURE AND NEEDS OF THE BOARD, THE COMPANYS CURRENT STRATEGIC NEEDS, SHAREHOLDERS EXPRESSED REASONS FOR WITHHOLDING VOTES, ACTUAL VOTE COUNTS AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND ANTICIPATED ROLES OF EACH OF MESSRS. LINN, WOLF AND YEARWOOD AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE BOARD NOT ACCEPT THE RESIGNATIONS.  THE BOARD DETERMINED THAT ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR RESIGNATIONS WOULD NOT BE IN THE COMPANYS BEST INTERESTS AND VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO REJECT THE RESIGNATIONS.  MESSRS. LINN, WOLF AND YEARWOOD DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE DELIBERATIONS OR THE VOTE.
 
MESSRS. LINN, WOLF AND YEARWOOD (THE TENDERING DIRECTORS) HAVE BEEN DIRECTORS SINCE 2012, 2013 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.  THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE COMPANYS ENHANCED STRATEGIC FOCUS, IMPROVED MARKET POSITION AND FOCUS ON MAINTAINING A SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY DOWNTURN.  BEGINNING IN 2013, THE BOARD UNDERTOOK A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIC REVIEW PROCESS AIMED AT UNLOCKING LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND IMPROVING CORE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE.  THAT REVIEW CULMINATED IN THE CLOSING OF A MERGER TRANSACTION LAST YEAR THAT COMBINED THE COMPANYS COMPLETION & PRODUCTION SERVICES BUSINESS LINE WITH C&J ENERGY SERVICES, INC., WHICH BOTH IMPROVED THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY WITH THE RECEIPT OF $693.5 MILLION IN CASH AND TRANSFORMED THE COMPANY INTO A PURE-PLAY DRILLING BUSINESS WITH A MAJORITY EQUITY INTEREST IN A LARGER, MORE FOCUSED PUBLIC COMPANY IN THE COMPLETION AND PRODUCTION SERVICES SPACE.  EACH OF THE TENDERING DIRECTORS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE STRATEGIC REVIEW PROCESS, WHICH SPANNED A PERIOD OF NEARLY TWO YEARS AND INVOLVED CONSIDERABLE ANALYSIS, DEBATE AND EVALUATION OF A MYRIAD OF COMPLEX OPPORTUNITIES AND ALTERNATIVES.  IN FACT, MR. WOLF WAS INITIALLY NOMINATED BY OUR THEN-LARGEST SHAREHOLDER SPECIFICALLY IN ANTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC REVIEW PROCESS.  FURTHERMORE, MR. WOLF HAS ALREADY INDICATED HIS INTENT TO RETIRE FROM THE BOARD AT THE 2017 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.  EACH OF THE TENDERING DIRECTORS HAS OFFERED UNIQUE AND VALUABLE INSIGHTS BASED UPON THEIR RESPECTIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY DURING THEIR TENURES, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW. THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE HELPED THE COMPANY NAVIGATE THE INDUSTRY DOWNTURN, AND THE BOARD BELIEVES THAT THEIR CONTINUED INPUT WILL ENHANCE THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN THE EVENTUAL RECOVERY.
 
FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM SHAREHOLDERS REVEALED FOUR SEPARATE REASONS UNDERLYING THE WITHHOLD VOTES FOR THE TENDERING DIRECTORS, EACH OF WHICH WAS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD IN DECLINING TO ACCEPT THE RESIGNATIONS.  FIRST, SEVERAL INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDERS VOTING POLICIES CALL FOR THEIR SHARES TO BE AUTOMATICALLY VOTED SOLELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF CERTAIN PROXY ADVISORY SERVICES, MOST NOTABLY ISS AND GLASS LEWIS, EACH OF WHICH RECOMMENDED WITHHOLD VOTES FOR THE TENDERING DIRECTORS. OTHERS SUBSCRIBE TO THOSE SERVICES, BUT RETAIN VARYING LEVELS OF DISCRETION INTERNALLY IN VOTING 
 
3





 
THEIR SHARES.  SECOND, SOME SHAREHOLDERS INDICATED CONCERNS REGARDING A LACK OF GENDER OR RACIAL DIVERSITY IN THE BOARDS COMPOSITION.  THIRD, SOME SHAREHOLDERS INDICATED CONCERNS REGARDING THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS. FINALLY, THE WITHHOLD VOTES APPEAR MOTIVATED BY CONCERNS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS RESPONSIVENESS TO SHAREHOLDER CONCERNS.
 
BASED UPON AVAILABLE DATA, THE BOARD ESTIMATES THAT ONE-THIRD OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS SHAREHOLDINGS ARE AUTOMATICALLY VOTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROXY ADVISORY SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS.  AN ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THOSE HOLDINGS ARE INFLUENCED BY SUCH RECOMMENDATIONS.  THE BOARD CONCLUDED, HOWEVER, THAT MANY OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS, INCLUDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS, ARE BASED UPON FLAWED OR INACCURATE INFORMATION, LEGACY CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED, AND IN SOME CASES GIVE UNDUE WEIGHT TO ISSUES THAT ARE OF LESSER RELATIVE IMPORTANCE IN EVALUATING THE SERVICE OF THOSE DIRECTORS.  CONTRIBUTING TO THIS PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT NEITHER GLASS LEWIS NOR ISS MAKES ITS RECOMMENDATIONS AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY IN ADVANCE OR AFFORDS THE COMPANY THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND OR COMMENT UPON ANY CONCERNS IT MAY HAVE.  AS SUCH, IN CONSIDERING THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON DIRECTORS, THE BOARD QUESTIONED WHETHER A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE WITHHOLD VOTES ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ACTUAL PREFERENCES OF SHAREHOLDERS WHOSE VOTES ARE AUTOMATICALLY VOTED AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OF SHAREHOLDERS WHO MAY HAVE RELIED UPON FLAWED OR INACCURATE STATEMENTS BY THE PROXY ADVISORY SERVICES.
 
THE BOARD CONTINUES TO BE FULLY COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY OF VIEWPOINTS, BACKGROUNDS AND EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING A CONSIDERATION OF GENDER, RACE AND AGE WHEN SEEKING DIRECTOR NOMINEES.  IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TWO MOST RECENT ADDITIONS TO THE BOARD IN 2013 AND 2014, INCLUDING MR. WOLF, WERE INITIALLY NOMINATED TO THE BOARD BY OUR THEN LARGEST SHAREHOLDER.  NONETHELESS, THE BOARD IS DEDICATED TO ATTAINING A DIVERSE COMPOSITION OF ITS MEMBERS, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON ACHIEVING ENHANCED GENDER AND RACE DIVERSITY AS AND WHEN OPEN POSITIONS BECOME AVAILABLE.
 
THE TENDERING DIRECTORS CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE DIRECTLY RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENTS TO THE COMPANYS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND, IN PARTICULAR, EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PRACTICES.  THEY WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN IMPLEMENTING THE DRASTIC CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION WHICH NOW PLACE THE COMPANY WITHIN THE RANGE OF COMPARABLE OILFIELD SERVICES COMPANIES IN TERMS OF MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION LEVELS, A COMPENSATION STRUCTURE THAT WAS APPROVED BY OVER 65% OF SHAREHOLDERS VOTING AT THE 2015 MEETING, FOLLOWING LESS THAN MAJORITY SUPPORT BETWEEN 2011 AND 2014.  DESPITE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS, CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS CONTINUE TO UNFAIRLY WEIGH HISTORICAL COMPENSATION CONCERNS THAT HAVE SINCE BEEN ADDRESSED.  AS MEMBERS OF THE COMPENSATION OR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES, MESSRS. LINN AND YEARWOOD EACH PLAYED SIGNIFICANT LEADERSHIP ROLES IN EFFECTING THOSE CHANGES (WHICH PREDATED MR. WOLFS APPOINTMENT TO THE BOARD).
 
THE PRIMARY CONCERN MOTIVATING WITHHOLD VOTES, AS EXPRESSED BY INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS AND PROXY ADVISORY SERVICES, WAS A LACK OF RESPONSIVENESS BY THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE TO PRIOR SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY VOTES, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO PROXY ACCESS.  THE BOARD REVIEWED AND WEIGHED THOSE VOTES, THE RESPONSES THERETO, AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BOARD OF EACH OF THE TENDERING DIRECTORS IN ITS DETERMINATION.
 
AT THE 2015 MEETING, A MAJORITY OF SHAREHOLDERS VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE PROXY ACCESS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL.  THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE HAD PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED A PROXY ACCESS POLICY, ONE OF THE FIRST PUBLIC COMPANIES TO DO SO, AND COMMITTED TO CONSIDER IN 2017 REDUCING THE SHARE OWNERSHIP REQUIRED TO NOMINATE A DIRECTOR UNDER THAT POLICY.  IN LIGHT OF THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE AT THAT MEETING, THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE COMMITTED TO CONDUCT THAT REVIEW IN ADVANCE OF THE 2016 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING, WHICH IT COMPLETED.  ALTHOUGH OTHER SHAREHOLDER CONCERNS WERE CITED BY SOME SHAREHOLDERS AND PROXY ADVISORY SERVICES, THE BOARD OBSERVED THAT THOSE CONCERNS WERE NOT SHARED BY A MAJORITY OF SHAREHOLDERS.  THE BOARD CONCLUDED THAT THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE HAD ADEQUATELY RESPONDED TO CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY A MAJORITY OF SHAREHOLDERS. THE BOARD ALSO CONSIDERED THAT, IN VIEW OF THE RESULTS OF THIS YEARS VOTE, MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE HAVE AGREED TO MEET WITH THE PROPONENTS OF THE PROXY ACCESS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE REMAINING CONCERNS.
 
4





 
ALSO AT THE 2015 MEETING, LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF SHAREHOLDERS VOTED IN FAVOR OF A PROPOSAL TO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PREPARE A SUSTAINABILITY REPORT ON ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES.  WHILE SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT REMAINED LOW AT THE 2015 MEETING, THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE NONETHELESS RESPONDED BY FULLY ENDORSING AND RECOMMENDING THE COMPANYS UNDERTAKING IN PUBLISHING ITS INAUGURAL CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FOR THE 2014 FISCAL YEAR AND THE SOON-TO-BE RELEASED 2015 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT.
 
THE BOARD ALSO CONSIDERED THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE, AS WELL AS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE TENDERING DIRECTORS GENERALLY, BEYOND THOSE DISCUSSED ABOVE.  AMONG THE CONTRIBUTIONS DISCUSSED BY THE BOARD WERE THE ELIMINATION OF A STAGGERED BOARD IN RESPONSE TO SHAREHOLDERS CONCERNS; A BYE-LAW AMENDMENT TO EFFECT THE BROKER NONVOTE CHANGE REQUESTED BY SHAREHOLDERS; ALLOWING A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF ITS CURRENT TERM IN 2016, THEREBY IMPLEMENTING THE RESULTS OF THE VOTE IN 2014; AND OVERHAULING THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE.  IN ADDITION, THE BOARD NOTED THAT NEARLY THE ENTIRE BOARD HAS TURNED OVER SINCE THE DEPARTURE OF THE PREVIOUS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MR. ISENBERG.  NOT ONLY HAS THAT ELIMINATED HISTORICALLY PERVASIVE CONCERNS OF DIRECTOR ENTRENCHMENT, THE CURRENT DIRECTORS ARE ALL RESPECTED LEADERS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRY.  IN PARTICULAR, THE GOVERNANCE & NOMINATING COMMITTEE, AS WELL AS THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MR. YEARWOOD (THE LEAD DIRECTOR), HAS IMPLEMENTED A SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE COMPARED TO THE COMPANYS PEERS.  IN ADDITION TO THE BOARDS ADOPTION IN 2014 OF A PROXY ACCESS POLICY, ONE OF THE FIRST IMPLEMENTED BY A PUBLIC COMPANY AS NOTED ABOVE, OVER 28% OF THE BOARD IS CURRENTLY COMPRISED OF DIRECTORS NOMINATED BY A SHAREHOLDER.
 
AFTER WEIGHING ALL OF THE FOREGOING FACTORS, THE BOARD CONCLUDED THAT ACCEPTING THE RESIGNATIONS OF THE TENDERING DIRECTORS WAS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY, AND IT DECLINED TO DO SO.

THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.  SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS DISCLOSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
 
WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AND NET DEBT FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE RELEASE. THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS THAT ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES.  ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES. NET DEBT IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS FROM TOTAL DEBT. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, AND NET DEBT TO TOTAL DEBT, WHICH ARE THEIR NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AND NET DEBT IN THE RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ACCURATELY REFLECT OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY AND PERFORMANCE.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, CERTAIN LIMITATIONS TO THESE MEASURES AND THEREFORE THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO AND NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OUR RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

WORLD FUEL SERVICES CORPORATION (THE “COMPANY”) IS FILING THIS FORM 8-K TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND DETAILS REGARDING THE CORRECTION OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DISCLOSED IN ITS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON JULY 28, 2016.  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2016, THE COMPANY IDENTIFIED A CORRECTION TO ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN CERTAIN PRIOR PERIODS DUE TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION CHANGES ON INTERCOMPANY LOANS THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OF A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT NATURE. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT HAD INCORRECTLY APPLIED THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN ASC 740, INCOME TAXES AND RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, RESULTING IN THE COMPANY REPORTING A LOWER PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIODS THAT WERE IMPACTED.  


 


IN ACCORDANCE WITH STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (“SAB”) NO. 99, MATERIALITY, AND SAB NO. 108, CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATED THE MATERIALITY OF THE ERROR FROM QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVES, AND CONCLUDED THE ERROR WAS NOT MATERIAL TO ITS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED ANNUAL AND INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS OF THE CORRECTIONS WERE APPROXIMATELY $20.0 MILLION, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $12.5 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015. THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF THE PRIOR PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY’S CURRENT STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME HAD IT MADE THE CORRECTION IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND, ACCORDINGLY THE COMPANY WILL REVISE ITS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROSPECTIVELY TO CORRECT THESE ERRORS.


 


THE CORRECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES LINE ITEM AS WELL AS OTHER IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE REFLECTED BELOW AND WILL ALSO BE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY’S REGULARLY FILED FINANCIAL REPORTS COMMENCING WITH ITS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED






  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE EFFECT OF THE CORRECTION ON THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014:

ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM U.S. OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURE FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY.  WE INCLUDED THE ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NABORS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO BE MORE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

APPROVAL OF 2013 ANNUAL INCENTIVE TARGETS  ON MARCH 13, 2013, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SUPERIOR ENERGY SERVICES, INC. (THE COMPANY) APPROVED THE INCENTIVE TARGETS FOR ITS 2013 ANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUS
PROGRAM. THE PARAMETERS OF THE PROGRAM PROVIDE FOR MINIMUM, TARGET AND MAXIMUM CASH BONUS AWARD LEVELS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALARY, BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF 80%, 100% AND 120% OF A PRE-TAX INCOME TARGET. 
DEPENDING ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE TARGET, THE BONUS PAYOUT LEVELS, WHICH VARY DEPENDING ON THE

 IF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OCCURS AT A LEVEL IN BETWEEN THESE FACTORS, A SLIDING SCALE IS USED TO
DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PAYOUT FACTOR. ASSUMING A PARTICULAR OFFICER QUALIFIES FOR A BONUS PAYOUT, THE ULTIMATE PAYOUT CAN BE REDUCED, BUT NOT INCREASED, BY A MAXIMUM OF 15% BASED ON THE COMPANYS OVERALL SAFETY PERFORMANCE FOR THE YEAR.
 ALL EXECUTIVE BONUSES ARE APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE PRIOR TO PAYOUT. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE RETAINS THE
DISCRETION TO ADJUST ANY BONUS AMOUNTS DETERMINED UNDER THE FORMULAS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE IN LIGHT OF THE PARTICULAR OFFICERS PERFORMANCE AND THE COMPANYS OVERALL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING
DISCRETIONARY ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RELATED METRICS.  APPROVAL OF 2012 ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS
 ON MARCH 13, 2013, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REVIEWED THE COMPANYS 2012 PERFORMANCE AND DETERMINED THAT THE
LEVEL OF PRE-TAX INCOME THAT WAS REQUIRED FOR OUR EXECUTIVES TO EARN A MINIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THE COMPANYS ANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUS PROGRAM FOR 2012 WAS NOT ACHIEVED. NOTWITHSTANDING THE RESULTS OF THE PROGRAM, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
DETERMINED THAT ANNUAL BONUS AWARDS TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WERE WARRANTED AFTER NOTING SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: THE COMPANYS PRE-TAX INCOME GROWTH ON A PRO-FORMA BASIS IN 2012 COMPARED TO A PRO FORMA BASIS IN 2011 REVIEWED
BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IN EARLY 2013 WAS STRONG RELATIVE TO OUR PEERS; THE FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET GOAL WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2012 AND NOT MANAGEMENTS FAILURE TO PERFORM (THE COMMITTEE
NOTED THAT AFTER THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, THE EXECUTIVES WERE ON PACE TO ACHIEVE PAYOUTS ABOVE TARGET); THE 2012 RESULTS WERE ONLY 3% BELOW THE THRESHOLD PAYMENT LEVEL; AND THE THRESHOLD LEVEL ITSELF WAS AGGRESSIVE WHEN SET BY THE COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ALSO NOTED THAT THE COMPANYS SAFETY PERFORMANCE FOR 2012 WOULD 



HAVE RESULTED IN A 5% DEDUCTION FROM ANY INCENTIVE AWARDS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM. AFTER TAKING THE 5% DEDUCTION INTO ACCOUNT, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINED TO BASE
THE ANNUAL BONUS AWARD ON 35% OF THE TARGET PAYOUT LEVEL UNDER THE 2012 ANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUS PROGRAM.  THE ANNUAL BONUS
AWARDS FOR 2012 APPROVED BY THE COMMITTEE FOR OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN ITEM 402(A)(3) OF REGULATION S-K) WERE AS FOLLOWS:

OTHER THINGS:   


 

 
 IMPLEMENT A MAJORITY VOTE STANDARD FOR UNCONTESTED DIRECTOR ELECTIONS; AND 
 


 

 
 FORMALIZE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS POLICY TO GIVE DUE CONSIDERATION TO THE BOARDS DIVERSITY OF MEMBERSHIP. 
THE COMPANYS AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS PROVIDE THAT DIRECTORS SHALL BE ELECTED BY A PLURALITY OF VOTES CAST BY STOCKHOLDERS. THE
PRINCIPLES NOW PROVIDE THAT FOR UNCONTESTED DIRECTOR ELECTIONS (ELECTIONS WHERE THE ONLY NOMINEES ARE THOSE RECOMMENDED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS), A DIRECTOR NOMINEE THAT IS ELECTED BY A PLURALITY OF VOTES BUT NONETHELESS RECEIVES MORE
WITHHELD VOTES THAN FOR VOTES WILL PROMPTLY TENDER HIS OR HER RESIGNATION TO THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION. THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE WILL GIVE ITS RECOMMENDATION
TO THE FULL BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHETHER TO ACCEPT THE TENDERED RESIGNATION OR TAKE SOME OTHER ACTION, INCLUDING REJECTING THE TENDERED RESIGNATION AND ADDRESSING THE APPARENT UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE WITHHELD VOTES. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
WILL ACT ON THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDATION NO LATER THAN AT ITS FIRST REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETING FOLLOWING CERTIFICATION OF THE STOCKHOLDER VOTE, BUT IN ANY EVENT WITHIN 120 DAYS FOLLOWING SUCH
CERTIFICATION, AND WILL PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECISION.  THE PRINCIPLES ALSO RECITE THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS BELIEF THAT A DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP WITH VARYING PERSPECTIVES AND BREADTH OF EXPERIENCE IS AN IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE OF A WELL-FUNCTIONING BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE PRINCIPLES FURTHER MAKE CLEAR THAT DIVERSITY IS INCLUSIVE OF BACKGROUND,
EXPERIENCE, GENDER, RACE AND SKILLS, AND THAT DIVERSITY WILL BE AN INTENTIONAL PART OF THE SEARCH PROCESS BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WITH RESPECT TO DIRECTOR CANDIDATES.

THE PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.  SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS DISCLOSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
 
WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UNDER REGULATION G.  WE PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE RELEASE.  THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS THAT ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  ADJUSTED EBITDA FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM OUR FORMER U.S. OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURE FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY.

2013 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
ON JUNE 6, 2013, THE STOCKHOLDERS OF SUPERIOR ENERGY SERVICES, INC. (THE COMPANY) APPROVED THE 2013 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
(THE PLAN). THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO INCREASE STOCKHOLDER VALUE AND TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES BY FURNISHING STOCK-BASED ECONOMIC INCENTIVES DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, REWARD AND MOTIVATE
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS AND ADVISORS TO THE COMPANY AND TO STRENGTHEN THE MUTUALITY OF INTERESTS BETWEEN SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS.  THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (OR A SUBCOMMITTEE) WILL GENERALLY ADMINISTER THE PLAN, AND HAS THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE AWARDS UNDER THE PLAN, INCLUDING SETTING THE TERMS OF THE AWARDS. THE COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE WILL ALSO GENERALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INTERPRET THE PLAN, TO ESTABLISH ANY RULES OR REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE PLAN THAT IT DETERMINES TO BE APPROPRIATE AND TO MAKE ANY OTHER DETERMINATION THAT IT BELIEVES NECESSARY OR ADVISABLE FOR
PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.  THE TYPES OF AWARDS THAT MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN INCLUDE STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED
STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WITH RESPECT TO WHICH AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS 8,000,000. THE PLAN USES A FUNGIBLE SHARE DESIGN,
WHICH MEANS THAT EACH SHARE ISSUED SUBJECT TO A STOCK OPTION OR SAR COUNTS AS ONE SHARE AGAINST THE PLAN LIMIT AND EACH SHARE ISSUED SUBJECT TO ANY OTHER INCENTIVE (THE FULL VALUE AWARDS) COUNTS AS 1.6 SHARES AGAINST THE PLAN LIMIT. NO INDIVIDUAL
MAY RECEIVE IN ANY FISCAL YEAR AWARDS UNDER THE PLAN, WHETHER PAYABLE IN CASH OR SHARES, THAT RELATE TO MORE THAN 1,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. FURTHER, THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF AN OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARD THAT IS VALUED IN DOLLARS
AND THAT IS SCHEDULED TO BE PAID OUT TO A PARTICIPANT IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS $10,000,000.  THE PLAN MAY BE AMENDED OR
TERMINATED AT ANY TIME BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE BOARD), SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT CERTAIN AMENDMENTS MAY NOT BE MADE WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. IN ADDITION, NO AMENDMENT MAY MATERIALLY IMPAIR AN AWARD
PREVIOUSLY GRANTED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE RECIPIENT. UNLESS TERMINATED SOONER, NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE UNDER THE PLAN AFTER JUNE 6, 2023.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE PLAN, SEE THE COMPANYS DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14A FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON APRIL 29, 2013. THE INFORMATION

COMMON STOCK AT A DISCOUNT DURING SIX-MONTH OFFERING PERIODS BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1 AND JULY 1 OF EACH YEAR AND ENDING ON JUNE 30 AND DECEMBER 31 OF EACH YEAR, RESPECTIVELY (THE OFFERING PERIODS). ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES
MAY PURCHASE SHARES THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS OF UP TO 10% OF TOTAL COMPENSATION PER PAY PERIOD, BUT MAY PURCHASE NO MORE THAN 1,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN ANY OFFERING PERIOD. THE PRICE PAID BY THE EMPLOYEES EQUAL TO 85% OF THE FAIR MARKET
VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK ON FIRST TRADING DAY OF THE OFFERING PERIOD OR THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE OFFERING PERIOD, WHICHEVER IS LESS. THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE PURCHASED THROUGH THE ESPP IS 3,000,000
SHARES. THE ESPP WILL GO INTO EFFECT ON JULY 1, 2013. THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESPP UNDER THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS OTHER PLAN PARTICIPANTS.

BOTH PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM, WE WORKED EXTENSIVELY TO ENGAGE OUR LARGEST INVESTORS AND ADVISORY FIRMS IN DISCUSSIONS IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT WE UNDERSTOOD AND ADDRESSED, IF POSSIBLE, THEIR CONCERNS AND
CONSIDERATIONS.  AS REPORTED IN ITEM 5.07, AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OUR STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED THE ADVISORY SAY-ON-PAY

SAY-ON-PAY PROPOSAL. BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE HAD WITH OUR LARGE INVESTORS, WE BELIEVE THIS VOTE REFLECTED OUR STOCKHOLDERS SUPPORT OF THE NEW PROGRAM. AS SUCH, WE HAVE ELECTED NOT TO CANCEL THE PROGRAM AND IT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE
ON JUNE 15, 2013. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CONTINUING CONCERNS AMONG SOME INVESTORS AND ADVISORY GROUPS, AND WE INTEND TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS IN THE COMING MONTHS IN ORDER TO GAIN FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THEIR VIEWS OF THE PROGRAM AND OUR

AS THIS RELEASE WAS LOCATED NEAR A NATURAL GAS PIPELINE RIGHT OF WAY, PRECAUTIONARY STEPS WERE TAKEN TO SECURE THE SCENE.  TESTING CONFIRMED THE RELEASE TO BE CARBON DIOXIDE GAS, SALTWATER, NATURAL GAS, AND SMALL AMOUNTS OF OIL.  WITH THE GAS IDENTIFIED AS PRIMARILY CARBON DIOXIDE, A GAS USED BY DENBURY ONSHORE FOR OIL WELL PRODUCTION, THE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY TOOK REMEDIAL ACTION TO STOP THE RELEASE AND CONTAIN AND RECOVER ALL LIQUIDS IN THE AFFECTED AREA.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY WORKING WITH GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES TO DETERMINE THE BEST COURSE OF REMEDIATION AND TO ENSURE THE ABSOLUTE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE COMMUNITY, ITS RESIDENTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WHILE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, DENBURY ONSHORE SUSPECTS THE CAUSE MAY BE ONE OR MORE OIL WELLS IN THE AREA THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY PLUGGED AND ABANDONED.  DENBURY ONSHORE IS TAKING ACTIONS TO CONFIRM THE CAUSE AND REMEDIATE THE ISSUE.  TO DATE, THE IMPACT ON OIL PRODUCTION FROM THE AFFECTED AREA OF THE FIELD, WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN AVERAGING ABOUT 1,500 BARRELS PER DAY NET TO DENBURY ONSHORE'S INTEREST, HAS BEEN MINIMAL.  CONTINUING TO PRODUCE FROM THE ACTIVE WELLS IN THIS AREA OF THE FIELD SERVES TO REDUCE OPERATING PRESSURE.  ADDITIONALLY, DENBURY ONSHORE HAS HALTED THE INJECTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE INTO THE AFFECTED AREA OF THE FIELD.  THE POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPACT ON THE AFFECTED AREA'S OIL PRODUCTION IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.   IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE NO INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELEASE, THE AREA IS SECURE AND POSES NO THREAT TO THE PUBLIC, AND ALL LIQUIDS ARE BEING CONTAINED AND RECOVERED.

THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).

AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY.

WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UNDER REGULATION G.  WE PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE RELEASE.  THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). ADJUSTED EBITDA IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM OUR FORMER U.S. OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURE FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY.

APPROVAL OF 2014 ANNUAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM  ON FEBRUARY 6, 2014, THE COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SUPERIOR ENERGY SERVICES, INC. (THE COMPANY) APPROVED ITS 2014 ANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUS PROGRAM. FOR 2014, ANNUAL BONUSES TO THE EXECUTIVE TEAM WILL BE BASED ON BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
MEASURES, WEIGHTED AS FOLLOWS: 75% OF THE TOTAL PAYOUT WILL BE BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A PRE-TAX INCOME TARGET AND 25% OF THE TOTAL PAYOUT WILL BE BASED ON THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEES ASSESSMENT OF THE EXECUTIVE TEAMS ACHIEVEMENT OF
CERTAIN QUALITATIVE OBJECTIVES. THE OVERALL INCENTIVE PAYOUT WILL RANGE FROM 0% TO 200% OF EACH EXECUTIVES TARGET BONUS OPPORTUNITY BASED ON THESE FACTORS. 
THE QUANTITATIVE PORTION OF THE BONUS PROVIDES FOR MINIMUM, TARGET AND MAXIMUM PAYOUT LEVELS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALARY, BASED UPON THE
ACHIEVEMENT OF 70%, 100% AND 110% OF A PRE-TAX INCOME TARGET. IF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OCCURS AT A LEVEL IN BETWEEN THESE FACTORS, A SLIDING SCALE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PAYOUT FACTOR. 
WITH RESPECT TO THE QUALITATIVE PORTION, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS APPROVED EXECUTIVE TEAM OBJECTIVES RELATING TO FINANCE, OPERATIONS AND
EXPANSION EFFORTS. THE COMMITTEE WILL EVALUATE THE EXECUTIVE TEAMS ACHIEVEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE OBJECTIVES, AND PAYOUT LEVELS WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON BELOW TARGET, AT TARGET AND ABOVE TARGET ACHIEVEMENTS. 
DEPENDING ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE APPLICABLE MEASURES, THE TOTAL BONUS PAYOUT LEVELS, WHICH VARY DEPENDING ON THE
EXECUTIVES POSITION, STATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE OFFICERS ANNUAL SALARY, ARE AS FOLLOWS:

 FOLLOWING THE COMMITTEES ASSESSMENT OF THE LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT OF THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
MEASURES DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMMITTEE WILL DETERMINE THE TOTAL BONUS PAYOUT EARNED BY EACH OFFICER UNDER THESE METRICS. SUCH TOTAL PAYOUT CAN BE REDUCED, BUT NOT INCREASED, BY A MAXIMUM OF 15% BASED ON THE COMPANYS OVERALL SAFETY PERFORMANCE
FOR THE YEAR.  ALL EXECUTIVE BONUSES ARE APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE PRIOR TO PAYOUT. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE RETAINS THE
DISCRETION TO ADJUST ANY BONUS AMOUNTS DETERMINED UNDER THE FORMULAS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE IN LIGHT OF THE PARTICULAR OFFICERS PERFORMANCE AND THE COMPANYS OVERALL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING
DISCRETIONARY ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RELATED METRICS. 


APPROVAL OF STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE AWARD PROGRAM 
ON FEBRUARY 12, 2014, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE APPROVED A SPECIAL TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE AWARD PROGRAM FOR EACH OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
OTHER THAN MR. DUNLAP, OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THIS AWARD WAS IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR LONG-TERM INCENTIVES ANNUALLY AWARDED TO OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, EACH PARTICIPATING EXECUTIVE RECEIVED A GRANT OF
PERFORMANCE SHARES UNDER OUR 2013 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN ON FEBRUARY 12, 2014, AND WILL RECEIVE A SECOND GRANT ON MARCH 1, 2015, ASSUMING THE EXECUTIVE IS EMPLOYED ON SUCH DATE, WITH EACH GRANT HAVING A ONE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. PAYOUT OF
BOTH GRANTS WILL NOT OCCUR UNTIL 2016. EACH AWARD WILL SET FORTH A TARGET NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARES, AND THE RECIPIENT WILL EARN BETWEEN 0% AND 150% OF THE TARGET AWARD BASED ON THE LEVEL OF FREE CASH FLOW ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY FOR EACH OF THE
FISCAL YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. UPON PAYOUT IN 2016, THE EARNED PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL CONVERT TO AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. 
THE NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED TO EACH EXECUTIVE IS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF HIS CURRENT SALARY AND EQUATES TO ONE-THIRD OF THE
EXECUTIVES TARGET VALUE AWARDED UNDER OUR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM. ON FEBRUARY 12, 2014, THE COMMITTEE APPROVED THE PERFORMANCE TARGETS AND PAYOUT MATRIX APPLICABLE TO THE 2014 GRANT. THE COMMITTEE WILL APPROVE THE PERFORMANCE TARGETS
AND PAYOUT MATRIX APPLICABLE TO THE MARCH 1, 2015 IN 2015 GRANT PRIOR TO THE GRANT DATE.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE GRANT
DATE VALUES APPROVED BY THE COMMITTEE FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN ITEM 402(A)(3) OF REGULATION S-K) FOR EACH GRANT UNDER THE PROGRAM. THE TARGET NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED ON EACH DATE WILL BE
DETERMINED BY DIVIDING THE GRANT DATE VALUE NOTED BELOW BY THE CLOSING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE APPLICABLE GRANT DATE:

WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UNDER REGULATION G.  WE PRESENTED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE RELEASE.  THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS THAT ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  ADJUSTED EBITDA FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY.

* MESSRS. LINN, YEARWOOD AND DR. LOMBARDI RECEIVED THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES VOTED (OR WITHHELD) IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ELECTION AND ACCORDINGLY TENDERED THEIR RESIGNATIONS. THE GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD CONSIDERED THE CURRENT STRUCTURE AND NEEDS OF THE BOARD, THE COMPANYS CURRENT STRATEGIC NEEDS, SHAREHOLDERS EXPRESSED REASONS FOR WITHHOLDING VOTES, ACTUAL VOTE COUNTS AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND ANTICIPATED ROLES OF EACH OF MESSRS. LINN AND YEARWOOD AND DR. LOMBARDI, AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE BOARD NOT ACCEPT THE RESIGNATIONS. THE BOARD DETERMINED THAT ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR RESIGNATIONS WOULD NOT BE IN THE COMPANYS BEST INTERESTS AND VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO REJECT THE RESIGNATIONS. MESSRS. LINN AND YEARWOOD AND DR. LOMBARDI DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE DELIBERATIONS OR THE VOTE.
 
MESSRS. LINN, YEARWOOD AND DR. LOMBARDI HAVE BEEN DIRECTORS SINCE 2012, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE COMPANYS ENHANCED STRATEGIC FOCUS AND IMPROVED MARKET POSITION. FURTHER, THEIR ACTIONS HAVE DIRECTLY RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENTS TO NABORS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND, IN PARTICULAR, EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PRACTICES. AS MEMBERS OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, THEY WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN IMPLEMENTING THE DRASTIC CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION WHICH NOW PLACE NABORS WITHIN THE RANGE OF COMPARABLE OILFIELD SERVICES COMPANIES IN TERMS OF MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION LEVELS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE CHANGES MATERIALLY REDUCED THE CEOS ANTICIPATED FORWARD ANNUAL COMPENSATION AND ELIMINATED THE SEVERANCE FEATURE ABOUT WHICH SHAREHOLDERS HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN. FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM SHAREHOLDERS LED THE BOARD TO CONCLUDE THAT THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE REFLECTS CONCERNS THAT RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE CEOS PRIOR YEARS COMPENSATION. NONE OF THESE DIRECTORS WERE INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN OR NEGOTIATION OF THE PRIOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM. FOR THESE REASONS, THE BOARD DECLINED TO ACCEPT THE RESIGNATIONS.
 
MINDFUL OF SHAREHOLDER CONCERNS, HOWEVER, THE BOARD TOOK TWO STEPS IN RESPONSE TO THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE FOR DIRECTORS TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. FIRST, THE BOARD DETERMINED THAT A CHANGE IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WAS WARRANTED. ACCORDINGLY, DR. LOMBARDI AND MR. YEARWOOD WERE REMOVED FROM THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND REPLACED BY MESSRS. CRANE AND KOTTS. MR. LINN WAS RETAINED AS A MEMBER OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE TO MAINTAIN SOME FUNCTIONAL CONTINUITY OVER COMMITTEE OPERATIONS AND BECAUSE HE RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF FOR VOTES. SECOND, AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 5.02 ABOVE AND IN THE PRESS RELEASE ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 99.1, THE BOARD EXPANDED ITS SIZE FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT DIRECTORS AND ADDED A NEW, INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR RECOMMENDED BY OUR LARGEST SHAREHOLDER. THE BOARD DETERMINED THAT AN ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT VOICE WITH DIVERSE EXPERIENCE AND THE SUPPORT OF OUR LARGEST SHAREHOLDER WOULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL ELEMENT OF INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT THAT WOULD MITIGATE ANY REMAINING CONCERNS OVER BOARD COMPOSITION.

ON APRIL 5, 2014, ENERGEN CORPORATION (ENERGEN) ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT) BY AND
AMONG ENERGEN, ALABAMA GAS CORPORATION (ALABAMA GAS) AND THE LACLEDE GROUP, INC. (LACLEDE), PURSUANT TO WHICH LACLEDE HAS AGREED TO ACQUIRE ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF ALABAMA GAS, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

1976, AS AMENDED, AND (III) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MATERIALITY EXCEPTIONS, THE ACCURACY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY THE PARTIES TO THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE STOCK
PURCHASE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IT IS A CONDITION TO ENERGENS OBLIGATIONS TO CLOSE THE ACQUISITION THAT IT HAVE OBTAINED AN AMENDMENT UNDER, OR REFINANCED, ITS OUTSTANDING BANK CREDIT FACILITIES ON TERMS WHICH ARE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO
ENERGEN SO AS TO NOT CAUSE THE OBLIGATIONS THEREUNDER TO BE IN DEFAULT UPON THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION. LACLEDES OBLIGATION TO CLOSE THE ACQUISITION IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY FINANCING CONDITION. THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION IS EXPECTED TO
OCCUR IN 2014, SUBJECT TO SATISFACTION OF CLOSING CONDITIONS.  THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF BOTH ENERGEN AND
LACLEDE AND OTHER COVENANTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES. THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT CONTAINS CERTAIN TERMINATION RIGHTS FOR ENERGEN AND LACLEDE, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE IF THE ACQUISITION IS NOT COMPLETED BY MAY 1,

TERMS, WHICH QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTED IN THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT. MOREOVER, SOME OF THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE OR COMPLETE AS OF ANY SPECIFIED DATE, MAY BE SUBJECT TO A
CONTRACTUAL STANDARD OF MATERIALITY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO INVESTORS OR MAY HAVE BEEN USED FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING RISK BETWEEN EACH PARTY RATHER THAN ESTABLISHING MATTERS AS FACT. BASED ON THE FOREGOING, YOU SHOULD NOT RELY

OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.  ON APRIL 1, 2014, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (THE COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE) OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE BOARD) OF GULFPORT ENERGY CORPORATION (THE COMPANY) RECOMMENDED THE APPROVAL OF, AND THE BOARD APPROVED, THE COMPANYS 2014 EXECUTIVE ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
(THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN). THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN IS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL BY THE COMPANYS STOCKHOLDERS AT THE 2014 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS. THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO EXECUTIVE
OFFICERS AND OTHER SELECTED EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH, PROFITABILITY AND INCREASED VALUE OF THE COMPANY BY PROVIDING CASH INCENTIVE COMPENSATION THAT QUALIFIES AS PERFORMANCE BASED COMPENSATION WITHIN THE
MEANING OF SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN FOCUSES ON ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN ANNUAL OBJECTIVES AND GOALS, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH CALENDAR YEAR, AND PROVIDES
THAT THE PARTICIPANTS MAY EARN A PRE-DETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BASE SALARIES FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCH SPECIFIED GOALS. UNDER THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN, THE PAYOUT OPPORTUNITY IS CONTINGENT UPON MEETING THE THRESHOLD PERFORMANCE
LEVELS, AND THEREAFTER VARIES FOR PERFORMANCE ABOVE AND BELOW THE PRE-ESTABLISHED TARGET PERFORMANCE LEVELS, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM AWARD LEVEL. THE TARGET AWARD TO A PARTICIPANT WILL REPRESENT A PERCENTAGE OF SUCH PARTICIPANTS BASE SALARY, AS
ADJUSTED BASED UPON MEETING OR EXCEEDING THE PERFORMANCE LEVELS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE FOR THAT YEAR, AND CANNOT EXCEED A MAXIMUM PAYMENT LIMIT SPECIFIED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN ALSO PROVIDES THAT
THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND COVERED EMPLOYEES WILL FORFEIT THE AWARD IF THEIR EMPLOYMENT DOES NOT CONTINUE THROUGH THE DATE THAT THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE CERTIFIES ATTAINMENT OF THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE TARGETS. 
THE PRECEDING SUMMARY OF THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF SUCH PLAN, A COPY OF WHICH IS
ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT 10.1 HERETO AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  ON APRIL 1, 2014, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED THE

ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS. FOR 2014, THE PERFORMANCE LEVELS REQUIRE ACHIEVING CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL METRICS, INCLUDING GROWTH IN EBITDA, ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES AND OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR
PERIOD. ALSO ON APRIL 1, 2014, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE GRANTED AN AWARD TO MICHAEL G. MOORE, THE COMPANYS INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, UNDER THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN, WHICH AWARD WILL REPRESENT 50%,
100% OR A MAXIMUM OF 200% OF HIS BASE SALARY, DEPENDING ON REACHING THE THRESHOLD, TARGET OR ABOVE-TARGET PERFORMANCE LEVELS.  AS
PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ON FEBRUARY 24, 2014, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AWARDED 24,868 SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK TO MR. MOORE UNDER THE 2013 RESTATED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN AS A RETENTION AWARD IN CONNECTION WITH HIS ASSUMPTION OF DUTIES AS
THE COMPANYS INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SUBJECT TO MR. MOORES CONTINUOUS SERVICE WITH THE COMPANY AND PREVIOUSLY SPECIFIED VESTING AND ACCELERATION PROVISIONS. AT THAT TIME, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DISCUSSED BUT DID NOT
FINALIZE A CASH ELEMENT OF THE PROPOSED RETENTION BONUS AWARD. ON APRIL 1, 2014, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINED TO PROVIDE MR. MOORE, AS AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE, A CASH RETENTION BONUS EQUAL TO $400,000. THE CASH BONUS AMOUNT WILL

WE ALSO PRESENTED IN THE PRESS RELEASE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UNDER REGULATION G.

THE COMPONENTS OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE COMPUTED BY USING AMOUNTS THAT ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  ADJUSTED EBITDA FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING THE SUM OF DIRECT COSTS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS COMPUTED SIMILARLY, BUT ALSO SUBTRACTS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FROM THE SUM OF OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS (LOSSES) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES. AS PART OF THE PRESS RELEASE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH IS ITS NEAREST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.
 
WE INCLUDED OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) DERIVED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE RELEASE BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA, INCLUDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OUR ONGOING PROFITABILITY.

ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2014, ENERGEN CORPORATION (ENERGEN) ENTERED INTO A SYNDICATED SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH
INITIAL AGGREGATE LENDER COMMITMENTS OF $1.5 BILLION PURSUANT TO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) AMONG ENERGEN, AS BORROWER, WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE INSTITUTIONS NAMED THEREIN AS
LENDERS. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS A SENIOR SECURED BORROWING BASE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH AN AGGREGATE MAXIMUM PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $2.5 BILLION, AN INITIAL BORROWING BASE OF $2.1 BILLION AND INITIAL AGGREGATE LENDER COMMITMENTS OF $1.5
BILLION. THIS CREDIT FACILITY REFINANCES AND REPLACES A $1.25 BILLION SYNDICATED UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDED BY BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND CERTAIN OTHER LENDERS TO ENERGEN AND GUARANTEED BY ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY
ENERGEN RESOURCES CORPORATION (ENERGEN RESOURCES) ON OCTOBER 30, 2012 (THE PRIOR REVOLVING FACILITY). TERMS USED IN THIS SECTION AND NOT DEFINED HEREIN HAVE THE RESPECTIVE MEANINGS GIVEN TO SUCH TERMS IN THE CREDIT
AGREEMENT.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS GUARANTEED ON A SENIOR BASIS BY ENERGEN RESOURCES AND WILL BE GUARANTEED BY ANY FUTURE MATERIAL
RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARY OF ENERGEN (TO BE REDETERMINED ON A PERIODIC BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT). ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE AVAILABLE TO ENERGEN IN AN AGGREGATE STATED AMOUNT NOT TO
EXCEED $100 MILLION AND SWINGLINE LOANS ARE AVAILABLE TO ENERGEN IN AN OUTSTANDING AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $100 MILLION, EACH SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABLE COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. 
THE CREDIT AGREEMENT HAS A MATURITY DATE OF AUGUST 30, 2019. 
BORROWINGS (OTHER THAN SWINGLINE BORROWINGS) UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL ACCRUE INTEREST, AT ENERGENS ELECTION, (I) AT THE
ALTERNATE BASE RATE, PLUS A MARGIN (THE ABR MARGIN) RANGING FROM 0.25% TO 1.25% DURING A NON-INVESTMENT GRADE PERIOD AND FROM 0.125% TO 0.75% DURING AN INVESTMENT GRADE PERIOD OR (II) FOR EURODOLLAR BORROWINGS, AT THE ADJUSTED

PORTION OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENTS WILL BE SUBJECT TO A COMMITMENT FEE RANGING FROM 0.30% TO 0.45% DURING A NON-INVESTMENT GRADE PERIOD AND FROM 0.150% TO 0.300% DURING AN INVESTMENT GRADE PERIOD. SWINGLINE BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL
ACCRUE INTEREST AT A DAILY FLOATING RATE EQUAL TO THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR ON SUCH DAY, PLUS THE EURODOLLAR MARGIN.  DURING A NON-INVESTMENT
GRADE PERIOD, THE APPLICABLE MARGIN AND COMMITMENT FEE ARE DEPENDENT UPON BORROWINGS RELATIVE TO THE THEN-EFFECTIVE BORROWING BASE. THE INITIAL BORROWING BASE IS $2.1 BILLION. DURING A NON-INVESTMENT GRADE PERIOD, THE BORROWING BASE WILL BE
REDETERMINED BY THE LENDERS AT LEAST SEMI-ANNUALLY ON EACH APRIL 1 AND OCTOBER 1, BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2015. ENERGEN AND THE LENDERS MAY EACH REQUEST ONE UNSCHEDULED BORROWING BASE REDETERMINATION BETWEEN EACH SCHEDULED REDETERMINATION.
ENERGEN MAY ALSO ELECT TO REQUEST A BORROWING BASE REDETERMINATION IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. THE BORROWING BASE WILL BE REDUCED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES UPON ANY ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED SENIOR OR UNSECURED SUBORDINATED DEBT, UPON
CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN HEDGING POSITIONS AND AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN ASSET SALES.  UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, ENERGEN IS OBLIGATED TO
COMPLY WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS REQUIRING IT TO MAINTAIN (I) A RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT TO CONSOLIDATED EBITDAX LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 4.0 TO 1.0, (II) A 



RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED CURRENT ASSETS TO CONSOLIDATED CURRENT LIABILITIES GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 1.0 TO 1.0, AND (III) DURING ANY INVESTMENT GRADE PERIOD ON WHICH ENERGEN DOES NOT HAVE BOTH
(A) AN UNSECURED RATING FROM MOODYS OF BAA3 OR BETTER AND (B) AN UNSECURED RATING FROM S&P OF BBB- OR BETTER, A RATIO OF THE PV-9 OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES TO CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 1.50 TO 1.00.
 IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS VARIOUS COVENANTS THAT LIMIT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ENERGENS ABILITY TO: INCUR
INDEBTEDNESS; GRANT LIENS; ISSUE PREFERRED STOCK; ENGAGE IN CERTAIN MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS, LIQUIDATIONS AND DISSOLUTIONS; ENGAGE IN CERTAIN SALES OF ASSETS; MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS AND DIVIDENDS; ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND MAKE
CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALLOWS ENERGEN TO HEDGE UP TO 85% OF ITS ANTICIPATED PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL
(INCLUDING NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND CONDENSATE) AND UP TO 85% OF ITS ANTICIPATED PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS, IN EACH CASE, AS SUCH PRODUCTION IS PROJECTED FROM ENERGENS PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES RESERVES. 
IF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE LENDERS WILL BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE THE MATURITY OF THE CREDIT FACILITY AND
EXERCISE OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. AN EVENT OF DEFAULT INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS: NONPAYMENT OF PRINCIPLE WHEN DUE; NONPAYMENT OF INTEREST, FEES OR OTHER AMOUNTS (SUBJECT TO A FIVE-BUSINESS DAY GRACE PERIOD); MATERIAL INACCURACY OF
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; VIOLATION OF COVENANTS; CROSS-DEFAULT IN EXCESS OF $75 MILLION; BANKRUPTCY EVENTS; CERTAIN ERISA EVENTS; JUDGMENTS IN EXCESS OF $75 MILLION; AND A CHANGE IN CONTROL.

RESOURCES OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SUCH THAT MORTGAGED PROPERTIES REPRESENT AT LEAST 80% OF THE PV-9 OF ITS PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE SECURED BY (A) THE PLEDGE OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS IN EACH
OF THE SUBSIDIARIES OF ENERGEN (OTHER THAN ENERGEN RESOURCES) AND OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS, (B) A SECURITY INTEREST GRANTED IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE OTHER ASSETS OF ENERGEN RESOURCES AND ANY OTHER SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS AND (C) CERTAIN
ASSETS OF ENERGEN (ALL SUCH SECURITY SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CARVE OUTS SET FORTH IN THE SECURITY INSTRUMENTS DELIVERED PURSUANT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT). THE LIEN ON ENERGENS ASSETS AS SECURITY FOR THIS NEW CREDIT FACILITY IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO
ASSETS THAT MAY BE PLEDGED BY ENERGEN WITHOUT TRIGGERING ANY REQUIREMENTS UNDER ENERGENS EXISTING INDENTURE TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR THE NOTES ISSUED UNDER SUCH EXISTING INDENTURE. 
IF ENERGEN RECEIVES AN UNSECURED RATING FROM AT LEAST ONE OF MOODYS OR S&P OF BAA3 OR BETTER OR BBB- OR BETTER, AS APPLICABLE, THEN
AT ENERGENS ELECTION, ENERGEN MAY ENTER INTO AN INVESTMENT GRADE PERIOD UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE INVESTMENT GRADE PERIOD). DURING THE INVESTMENT GRADE PERIOD, ALL SECURITY INTERESTS SHALL BE RELEASED. ADDITIONALLY, DURING AN
INVESTMENT GRADE PERIOD, THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND THE COMMITMENT FEE WILL SHIFT SUCH THAT PRICING WILL BE BASED ON ENERGENS RATINGS, AND THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE TO BE DRAWN WILL BE BASED SOLELY ON THE
OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS OF THE LENDERS AND NOT LIMITED BY THE BORROWING BASE.  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES,
CERTAIN OF THE LENDERS AND OTHER PARTIES TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES HAVE ENGAGED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ENGAGE, IN COMMERCIAL BANKING, INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL ADVISORY OR OTHER SERVICES TO ENERGEN AND ITS

OTHER EVENTS.  NOTES OFFERING 
ON OCTOBER 6, 2016, GULFPORT ENERGY CORPORATION (GULFPORT) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING THAT IT PROPOSES TO OFFER,
SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, $650 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ITS SENIOR NOTES DUE 2024 (THE NOTES) TO FUND THE REPURCHASE OF ITS OUTSTANDING 7.750% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020. THE NOTES WILL BE OFFERED TO
QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE SECURITIES ACT), AND TO CERTAIN NON-U.S. PERSONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (THE NOTES
OFFERING). A COPY OF THE PRESS RELEASE IS ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 99.1 AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  THE NOTES
WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES ABSENT REGISTRATION OR AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS. THIS REPORT IS NEITHER AN OFFER TO
SELL NOR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY ANY OF THESE SECURITIES AND SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER, SOLICITATION OR SALE IN ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH OFFER, SOLICITATION OR SALE IS UNLAWFUL. 
CERTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  IN
CONNECTION WITH THE NOTES OFFERING DISCUSSED ABOVE, GULFPORT INTENDS TO DISCLOSE TO POTENTIAL INVESTORS THE FOLLOWING:  ESTIMATED PROVED
RESERVES AND HEDGE POSITION BASED ON CURRENT NYMEX PRICING  GULFPORTS PROVED RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WERE CALCULATED,
AS REQUIRED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC), USING PRICES BASED ON THE 12-MONTH UNWEIGHTED ARITHMETIC AVERAGE OF THE FIRST-DAY-OF-THE MONTH PRICE FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY THROUGH DECEMBER 2015 OF $50.28 PER BARREL AND
$2.59 PER MMBTU. HOLDING PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS CONSTANT, IF GULFPORTS 2015 RESERVES WERE CALCULATED USING THE OCTOBER 5, 2016 NYMEX STRIP PRICING OF $47.81 PER BARREL AND $3.08 PER MMBTU IN 2016, $52.76 PER BARREL AND $3.19 PER
MMBTU IN 2017, $54.64 PER BARREL AND $2.98 PER MMBTU IN 2018, $55.78 PER BARREL AND $2.86 PER MMBTU IN 2019, AND $56.87 PER BARREL AND $2.87 PER MMBTU THEREAFTER, GULFPORTS PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUES DISCOUNTED AT 10%
(PV-10) WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $1,194.1 MILLION AS COMPARED TO GULFPORTS ACTUAL PV-10 VALUE OF $765.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. 
THE VALUE OF GULFPORTS HEDGE POSITION AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 USING DECEMBER 31, 2015 SEC PRICING DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT VALUE
USING A 10% DISCOUNT RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY $135.0 MILLION. THE VALUE OF GULFPORTS HEDGE POSITION AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 USING OCTOBER 5, 2016 NYMEX PRICING DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT VALUE USING A 10% DISCOUNT RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY
$(8.1) MILLION.  ADDITIONAL RISK FACTOR 
OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH BELOW, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE RISK FACTORS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN GULFPORTS ANNUAL REPORT ON
FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 OR SUBSEQUENT FILINGS IT MAKES WITH THE SEC.  RECENT DECISIONS BY THE OHIO SUPREME COURT INTERPRETING
THE OHIO DORMANT MINERAL ACT RELATING TO PRESERVATION OF MINERAL RIGHTS BY SURFACE OWNERS COULD REQUIRE CERTAIN CURATIVE EFFORTS TO VEST TITLE IN A PORTION OF GULFPORTS LEASEHOLD ACREAGE, INCREASE ITS LEASEHOLD EXPENSES, SUBJECT
IT TO PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL ROYALTIES AND/OR RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SOME OF ITS LEASEHOLD ACREAGE IN OHIO.  ON
SEPTEMBER 15, 2016, THE OHIO SUPREME COURT ISSUED A SERIES OF DECISIONS RELATING TO THE OHIO DORMANT MINERAL ACT (THE ODMA). IN THE LEAD CASE, CORBAN V. CHESAPEAKE EXPLORATION L.L.C., THE COURT CONCLUDED THAT THE 1989 VERSION OF
THE ODMA DID NOT TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF DORMANT MINERAL RIGHTS AUTOMATICALLY, BY OPERATION OF LAW. INSTEAD, PRIOR TO 2006, SURFACE OWNERS WERE REQUIRED TO BRING A QUIET TITLE ACTION IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH ABANDONMENT OF MINERAL RIGHTS. AFTER JUNE 30,
2006 (THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 2006 VERSION OF THE ODMA), SURFACE OWNERS ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE STATUTORY NOTICE AND RECORDING PROCEDURES ENACTED IN 2006. GULFPORT IS ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THESE RECENT OHIO SUPREME COURT DECISIONS ON ITS
OPERATIONS IN OHIO WHERE THE MAJORITY OF ITS ACREAGE AND ITS PRODUCING PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED. HOWEVER, THE OHIO SUPREME COURT DECISIONS COULD REQUIRE CERTAIN CURATIVE EFFORTS TO VEST TITLE IN A PORTION OF GULFPORTS LEASEHOLD ACREAGE, INCREASE
ITS LEASEHOLD EXPENSES, SUBJECT IT TO PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL ROYALTIES AND/OR RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SOME OF ITS LEASEHOLD ACREAGE IN OHIO, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON GULFPORTS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OTHER PERSON REFERENCED THEREIN. FURTHERMORE, YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON THE COVENANTS IN THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT AS ACTUAL LIMITATIONS ON THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY BECAUSE THE COMPANY MAY TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS THAT ARE EITHER EXPRESSLY PERMITTED

REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS, THERE ARE NUMEROUS VARIABLES OF AN UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OR OUTSIDE OF DRIL-QUIPS CONTROL THAT COULD AFFECT DRIL-QUIPS FUTURE RESULTS AND THE VALUE OF ITS SHARES. EACH INVESTOR MUST ASSESS AND BEAR THE RISK OF
UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K. PLEASE REFER TO DRIL-QUIPS FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY

THE VALUE OF GULFPORTS HEDGE POSITION AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 USING DECEMBER 31, 2015 SEC PRICING DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT VALUE
USING A 10% DISCOUNT RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY $135.0 MILLION. THE VALUE OF GULFPORTS HEDGE POSITION AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 USING OCTOBER 5, 2016 NYMEX PRICING DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT VALUE USING A 10% DISCOUNT RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY
$(8.1) MILLION.  ADDITIONAL RISK FACTOR 
OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH BELOW, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE RISK FACTORS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN GULFPORTS ANNUAL REPORT ON
FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 OR SUBSEQUENT FILINGS IT MAKES WITH THE SEC.  RECENT DECISIONS BY THE OHIO SUPREME COURT INTERPRETING
THE OHIO DORMANT MINERAL ACT RELATING TO PRESERVATION OF MINERAL RIGHTS BY SURFACE OWNERS COULD REQUIRE CERTAIN CURATIVE EFFORTS TO VEST TITLE IN A PORTION OF GULFPORTS LEASEHOLD ACREAGE, INCREASE ITS LEASEHOLD EXPENSES, SUBJECT
IT TO PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL ROYALTIES AND/OR RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SOME OF ITS LEASEHOLD ACREAGE IN OHIO.  ON
SEPTEMBER 15, 2016, THE OHIO SUPREME COURT ISSUED A SERIES OF DECISIONS RELATING TO THE OHIO DORMANT MINERAL ACT (THE ODMA). IN THE LEAD CASE, CORBAN V. CHESAPEAKE EXPLORATION L.L.C., THE COURT CONCLUDED THAT THE 1989 VERSION OF
THE ODMA DID NOT TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF DORMANT MINERAL RIGHTS AUTOMATICALLY, BY OPERATION OF LAW. INSTEAD, PRIOR TO 2006, SURFACE OWNERS WERE REQUIRED TO BRING A QUIET TITLE ACTION IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH ABANDONMENT OF MINERAL RIGHTS. AFTER JUNE 30,
2006 (THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 2006 VERSION OF THE ODMA), SURFACE OWNERS ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE STATUTORY NOTICE AND RECORDING PROCEDURES ENACTED IN 2006. GULFPORT IS ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THESE RECENT OHIO SUPREME COURT DECISIONS ON ITS
OPERATIONS IN OHIO WHERE THE MAJORITY OF ITS ACREAGE AND ITS PRODUCING PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED. HOWEVER, THE OHIO SUPREME COURT DECISIONS COULD REQUIRE CERTAIN CURATIVE EFFORTS TO VEST TITLE IN A PORTION OF GULFPORTS LEASEHOLD ACREAGE, INCREASE
ITS LEASEHOLD EXPENSES, SUBJECT IT TO PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL ROYALTIES AND/OR RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SOME OF ITS LEASEHOLD ACREAGE IN OHIO, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON GULFPORTS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
